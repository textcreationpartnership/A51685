            <p>Created by converting TCP files to TEI P5 using tcp2tei.xsl,
      TEI @ Oxford.

         <editorialDecl>
            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,368 texts created during Phase 1 of the project (2000-2009), initially available only to institutions that contributed to their creation, were released into the public domain on 1 January 2015. The approximately 40,000 texts produced during Phase 2 (2009- ), of which 34,963 had been released as of 2020, originally similarly restricted, were similarly freed from all restrictions on 1 August 2020. As of that date anyone is free to take and use these texts for any purpose (modify them, annotate them, distribute them, etc.). But we do respectfully request that due credit and attribution be given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <opener>
               <salute>SIR,</salute>
            </opener>
            <p>I Have ſent you the Treatiſe of Morali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty which you deſire of me with ſo much importunity. It is divided into two Parts. In the Firſt I have examin'd wherein Vertue doth preciſely conſiſt, and laid down the means of acquiring and preſerving it: The Second contains the Duties of it. I know not what Cenſure you will paſs on this Book, you, Sir, who are ſo nice a Judge; for I confeſs to you that there are many things in it, which I have not explain'd with that exact<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs which you require of Authors. But I deſire you to conſider two Things. The Firſt is, that having no clear Idea of the Soul, you underſtand what I mean, the greateſt part of the Terms of Morality can expreſs only its Senſations. The Second is, that Books ought to be proportion'd, as far as it is poſſible, to the Capacity of the gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rality
<pb facs="tcp:97672:3"/>of Mankind, and that if I had been too nice and ſcrupulous in explaining the ſignification of the Terms which I make uſe of, I ſhould have extremely tir'd the Atten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions of my Readers; for People are ſoon weary of reading a Book that doth not raiſe agreable Senſations in their Mind. Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>haps I may think it neceſſary hereafter to add ſome Illuſtrations which may clear thoſe Difficulties which the common Phraſe of Speech cannot remove. The ſucceſs that this Treatiſe meets with, will determine my Reſolution in that Point.</p>

True and Falſe, Juſt and <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>njuſt is the ſame in reſpect of all intelligent Beings, and of God himſelf. What Truth and Order is, and what we muſt do to avoid Sin and Error. God is eſſentially Juſt; he loves the Creatures according as they are amiable, or as they reſemble him. We muſt be Perfect to be Happy; Vertue, or the Perfection of Man conſiſts in a Submiſſion to the immutable Order, and not in following the Order of Nature. The Error of ſome of the Heathen Philoſophers in this Matter, ground<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed upon their Ignorance of the ſimplicity and immutabili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty of the Divine Conduct. <hi>Page 1.</hi>
               </item>
               <label>CHAP. II.</label>
               <item>There is no other Vertue but the Love of Order and Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon. Without this Love all Vertues are falſe. We muſt not confound Duties with Vertue: We may diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>charge our Duties without Vertue. 'Tis for want of con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſulting Reaſon that Men approve and follow damna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble Cuſtoms. Faith ſerves or conducts to Reaſon: For Reaſon is the ſupreme Law of all intelligent Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings. <hi>p. 12.</hi>

               <pb facs="tcp:97672:4"/>
               <label>CHAP. III.</label>
               <item>The Love of Order doth not differ from Charity. Two ſorts of Love, one of <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>nion, and the other of Benevolence. The former is due only to Power, or to God alone. The latter ought to be proportion'd to perſo<gap reason="illegible" resp="#UOM" extent="3 letters">

                  </gap> Merit, as our Duties to relative. Self-love enlightned is not contrary to the love of <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>nion. The love of Order is common to all Men. The Species of the love of Order, natural and free, actual and habitual. Only that which is free, habitual and ruling renders us juſt in the ſight of God. So that Vertue conſiſts in nothing but a free, habitual and ruling Love of the immutable Order. <hi>p. 21.</hi>
               </item>
               <label>CHAP. IV.</label>
               <item>Two fundamental Truths belonging to this Treatiſe. <hi>I.</hi> Acts produce Habits, and Habits Acts. <hi>II.</hi> The Soul doth not always produce the Acts of its ruling Habit. The Sinner may avoid committing any particular Sin, and the juſt Man may loſe his Charity, becauſe there is no Sinner without ſome love for Order, and no juſt Man without Self-love. We cannot be juſtified in the ſight of God by the ſtrength of Free-will. The means in general of acquiring and preſerving Charity. The me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thod us'd in the explication of theſe means. <hi>p. 23.</hi>
               </item>
               <label>CHAP. V.</label>
               <item>Of the Strength of the Mind. Our Deſires are the occa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſional Cauſes of our Knowledge. The Contemplation of abſtract Ideas is difficult. The Strength of the Mind conſiſts in an acquir'd Habit of enduring the Labour of Attention. The way to acquire it is to Silence our Sen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes, Imagination and Paſſions, to Regulate our Studies, and to Meditate only on clear Ideas. <hi>p. 40.</hi>
               </item>
               <label>CHAP. VI.</label>
               <item>Of the Liberty of the Mind. We ſhould ſuſpend our Aſſent as much as we can, which is the great Rule. By the
<pb facs="tcp:97672:4"/>Liberty of the Mind we may avoid Error and Sin, as by the Strength of the Mind we free our ſelves from Ig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>norance. The Liberty of the Mind, as well as the Strength of it, is a Habit which is confirm'd by uſe. Some inſtances of its <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>ſefulneſs in Phyſicks, Morality, and Civil Life. <hi>p. 51.</hi>
               </item>
               <label>CHAP. VII.</label>
               <item>Of Obedience to Order. The means of acquiring a firm and ruling Diſpoſition to obey it. It cannot be done without Grace. How far the right uſe of our Strength and Liberty contributes toward it, by the Light it pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duces in us, by the contemptible Opinion it gives us of our Paſſions, and by the Purity which it preſerves and eſtabliſhes in our Imagination. <hi>p. 61.</hi>

               <label>CHAP. VIII.</label>
               <item>The Means which Religion furniſhes us with to gain and preſerve the Love of Order. Jeſus Chriſt is the occa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſional Cauſe of Grace; we muſt call upon him with con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fidence. When we come to the Sacraments, the actual Love of Order is chang'd into habitual, in conſequence of the permanent deſires of Chriſt: The Proof of this Truth being eſſential to the Converſion of Sinners. The fear of Hell is as good a Motive as the deſire of eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal Happineſs. We muſt not confound the Motive with the End. The deſire of being Happy, or Self-love, ſhould make us conformable to Order, or obedient to the Law of God. <hi>p. 71.</hi>
               </item>
               <label>CHAP. IX.</label>
               <item>The Church in its Prayers Addreſſes its ſelf to the Father by the Son, and why. We ſhould Pray to the Bleſſed Virgin, Angels and Saints, but not as occaſional cauſes of inward Grace. The Angels, and even the Devils have power over Bodies, as occaſional cauſes. By this means the Devils may tempt us, and the Angels pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mote the efficacy of Grace. <hi>p. 83.</hi>

               <label>CHAP. X.</label>
               <item>Of the Occaſional Cauſes of the Senſations and Motions of the Soul which reſiſt the Efficacy of Grace, either of Light or Senſe. The <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>nion of the Soul with God is immediate, not that of the Soul with the Body. An Explication of ſome general Laws of the <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>nion of the Soul and Body, neceſſary for the right underſtanding the reſt of this Treatiſe. <hi>p. 91.</hi>
               </item>
               <label>CHAP. XI.</label>
               <item>What kind of death we muſt die to ſee God, to be united to Reaſon, and to deliver our ſelves from Concupiſcence. It is the Grace of Faith that gives us this happy death. Chriſtians are dead to Sin by Baptiſm, and alive in Chriſt by his Reſurrection. Of the Mortification of the Senſes, and the uſe we ſhould make of it. We ſhould unite our ſelves to corporeal Objects, and ſeparate our ſelves from them without loving or fearing them. But the ſureſt way is to break off all Correſpondence with them, as far as is poſſible. <hi>p. 99.</hi>
               </item>
               <label>CHAP. XII.</label>
               <item>Of the Imagination. This Term is obſcure and confus'd. What it is in general. Several ſorts of Imaginati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on. Its effects are dangerous. Of that which the World calls Wit. That quality is very oppoſite to the Grace of Chriſt. It is fatal to thoſe who poſſeſs it, and to thoſe who eſteem and admire it in others, tho' they have it not themſelves. <hi>p. 109.</hi>
               </item>
               <label>CHAP. XIII.</label>

We cannot love Evil: But we may take that for Evil, which is neither Good nor Evil. So we cannot hate Good: But the true Good is really the Evil of wicked Men, or the true cauſe of their Miſery. That God may be Good in reſpect of us, our Love muſt be like his, or always ſubject to the divine Law, Motions or Duties. <hi>p. 21.</hi>

                  <note place="margin">See the firſt and ſecond Chriſtian Meditation, or the Illu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtration on the Nature of Ideas, <hi>Search af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter Truth,</hi> Tom. 3.</note> or the Wiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom of God himſelf; for every Creature is a particular Being; but the Reaſon of Man is Univerſal.</p>
               <pb n="2" facs="tcp:97672:8"/>
               <p n="2">II. If my own particular Mind were my Reaſon and my Light, my Mind would alſo be the Reaſon of all intelligent Beings; for I am certain, that my Reaſon enlightens all intelligent Beings. No one can feel my Pain but my ſelf, but every one may ſee the Truth which I contemplate; ſo that the Pain which I feel is a Modification of my own proper Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance, but Truth is a Poſſeſſion common to all Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritual Beings.</p>
               <p n="3">III. Thus, by the means of Reaſon, I have, or may have ſome Society with God, and all other in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>telligent Beings; becauſe they all poſſeſs ſomething in common with me, to wit, Reaſon.</p>
               <p n="4">IV. This Spiritual Society conſiſts in a participation of the ſame intellectual Subſtance of the Word, from which all Spiritual Beings may receive their Nouriſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment. In contemplating this Divine Subſtance, I am able to ſee ſome part of what God thinks; for God ſees all Truths, and there are ſome which I can ſee. I can alſo diſcover ſomething of the Will of God; for God wills nothing but according to a certain Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der, and this Order is not altogether unknown to me. It is certain that God loves Things according as they are worthy of Love; and I can diſcover that there are ſome Things more Perfect, more Valuable, and conſequently more worthy of Love than others.</p>
               <p n="5">V. It is true, indeed, that I cannot by contemplating the Word or conſulting Reaſon, be aſſur'd whether God doth actually produce any thing out of his own Being or no. For none of the Creatures proceed natu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rally from the Word; nor is the World a neceſſary ema<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation of the Deity; God is fully ſufficient for himſelf; and the Idea of a Being infinitely perfect, may be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiv'd to ſubſiſt alone. The Creatures then ſuppoſe in God free and arbitrary Decrees, which give them their Being. So that the Word, as ſuch, not contain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing in it the Exiſtence of the Creatures, we cannot by the Contemplation of it be aſſur'd of the Action of God: But ſuppoſing that God doth act, I am able to know ſomething of the manner in which he acts, and may be certain that he doth not act in ſuch or ſuch a manner; for that which regulates his manner
<pb n="3" facs="tcp:97672:8" rendition="simple:additions"/>of Acting, the Law which he inviolably obſerves, is the Word, the Eternal Wiſdom, the Univerſal Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon, which makes me Rational, and which I can in part contemplate according to my own deſires.</p>
               <p n="6">VI. If we ſuppoſe Man to be a Rational Creature, we cannot certainly deny him the Knowledge of ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing that God thinks, and of the manner in which he acts. For by contemplating the ſubſtance of the Word, which alone makes me and all other intelligent Beings Rational, I can clearly diſcover the Relations or Proportions of Greatneſs that are between the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tellectual Ideas comprehended in it; and theſe Rela<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions are the ſame eternal Truths which God himſelf ſees. For God ſees as well as I, that twice two is four, and that Triangles which have the ſame Baſe, and are between the ſame Parallels, are equal. I can alſo diſcover, at leaſt confuſedly, the Relations of Perfe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction which are between the ſame Ideas; and theſe Relations are that immutable Order which God con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſults when he acts, and which ought alſo to regulate the Eſteem and Love of all intelligent Beings.</p>
               <p n="7">VII. From hence it is evident, that there are ſuch things as True and Falſe, Right and Wrong, and that too in reſpect of all intelligent Beings; that whatſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever is true in reſpect of Man, is true alſo in reſpect of Angels, and of God himſelf; that what is Injuſtice or Diſorder with relation to Man, is ſo alſo with re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lation to God. For all Spiritual Beings contemplat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the ſame intellectual Subſtance, neceſſarily diſco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver in it the ſame Relations of Greatneſs, or the ſame ſpeculative Truths. They diſcover alſo the ſame pra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctical Truths, the ſame Laws, and the ſame Order, when they ſee the Relations of Perfection that are be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween thoſe intellectual Beings comprehended in the Subſtance of the Word, which alone is the immediate Object of all our Knowledge.</p>
               <p n="8">VIII. I ſay, when they ſee theſe Relations of Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fection or Greatneſs, and not when they judge of them; for only Truth or the real Relations of Things are viſible, and we ought to judge of nothing but what we ſee. When we judge before we ſee, or of more things than we ſee, we are deceiv'd in our Judgment, or at
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:97672:9" rendition="simple:additions"/>leaſt we judge ill, tho' we may happen by chance not to be deceiv'd: For when we judge of things by chance, as well as when we judge by Paſſion or In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tereſt, we judge ill, becauſe we do not judge by Evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence and Light. This is Judging by our ſelves and not by Reaſon, or according to the Laws of Univer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſal Reaſon: That Reaſon, I ſay, which alone is ſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>periour to Spirits, and hath a Right to judge of thoſe Judgments which are pronounc'd by them.</p>
               <p n="9">IX. The Mind of Man being finite, cannot ſee all the Relations that the Objects of its Knowledge bear to one another; ſo that it may be deceiv'd when it judges of Relations which it doth not ſee. But if it judg'd of nothing but juſt what it ſaw, which without doubt it may do; certainly, tho' it be a finite Spirit, tho' it be Ignorant, and in its own Nature ſubject to Error, it would never be deceiv'd; for then the Judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments fram'd by it would not proceed ſo much from it ſelf, as from the Univerſal Reaſon pronouncing the ſame Judgments in it.</p>
               <p n="10">X. But God is infallible in his own Nature; he cannot be ſubject to Error or Sin, for he is his own Light, and his own Law; Reaſon is conſubſtantial with him, he underſtands it perfectly, and loves it in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vincibly. Being infinite, he diſcovers all the Rela<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions that are comprehended in the intellectual Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance of the Word; and therefore cannot judge of what he doth not ſee. And as he loves himſelf invin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cibly, ſo he cannot but eſteem and love other things according as they are valuable and according as they are amiable.</p>
               <p n="11">XI. It is probable that Angels and Saints, tho' in their own Nature ſubject to Error, are never deceiv'd; becauſe the leaſt attention of Mind repreſents to them clearly the Ideas of things and their ſeveral Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lations; they judge of nothing but what they ſee; they follow the Light, and do not go before it; they obey the Law, and do not ſet themſelves above it: In them Reaſon alone judges definitively and without appeal. But Man, ſuch as I find my ſelf to be, is of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten deceiv'd, becauſe the labour of Attention is ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tremely tireſom to him; and tho' his Application be
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:97672:9" rendition="simple:additions"/>ſtrong and painful, he hath commonly but a con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fus'd fight of Objects. Thus being weary and not much enlightned, he repoſes himſelf on probability, and contents himſelf for ſome time with the enjoy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of a falſe Good; but being ſoon out of reliſh with it, he begins his ſearch anew, till being tir'd or ſeduc'd again he takes ſome reſt, till he be in a con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition to begin afreſh, tho' weakly, his difficult en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quiries.</p>
               <p n="12">XII. Since ſpeculative and practical Truths are no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing elſe but relations of Greatneſs or Perfection, it is evident that Falſhood is not any thing real. That twice two is four, or that twice two is not five is true, becauſe there is a Relation of Equality be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween twice two and four, and a relation of Inequali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty between twice two and five. And he that ſees theſe relations, ſees Truths, becauſe the relations are real. That twice two is five, or that twice two is not four is falſe, becauſe there is no relation of equa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity between twice two and five, nor of inequality be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween twice two and four. And he that ſees, or ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther believes he ſees theſe relations, ſees Falſities. He ſees relations that are not. He thinks he ſees, but indeed he doth not ſee; for Truth is intelligible, but Falſhood in it ſelf is abſolutely incomprehenſible.</p>
               <p n="13">XIII. In like manner, that a Beaſt is more valuable than a Stone, and leſs valuable than a Man is true; becauſe a Beaſt bears a greater proportion or relation of perfection to a Stone, than a Stone doth to a Beaſt; and a Beaſt hath a leſs proportion of perfection com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>par'd to a Man, than a Man hath compar'd to a Beaſt. And he that ſees theſe Relations, ſees ſuch Truths as ought to regulate his eſteem, and conſequently that ſort of Love that is determin'd by eſteem: But he that eſteems his Horſe more than his Coachman, or thinks that a Stone is in it ſelf more valuable than a Flie, or than the very leaſt of organiz'd Bodies, doth not ſee that which perhaps he thinks he doth; it is not univerſal Reaſon, but his own particular Reaſon, that makes him judge after that manner: It is not the love of Order, but ſelf-love, which inclines him to love as he doth. That which he thinks he ſees, is
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:97672:10" rendition="simple:additions"/>neither viſible nor intelligible; 'tis a falſe and imagi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nary Relation: And he that governs his eſteem or love by this or the like Relation, muſt neceſſarily fall into Error and Irregularity.</p>
               <p n="14">XIV. Since Truth and Order are Relations of great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs and perfection, real immutable and neceſſary re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lations, relations comprehended in the ſubſtance of the Divine Word; he that ſees theſe relations, ſees that which God ſees: He that regulates his Love according to theſe Relations, obſerves a Law which God invincibly Loves. So that there is a perfect conformity of Mind and Will between God and him. In a word, ſeeing he knows that which God knows, and loves that which God loves, he is like God, as far as he is capable of be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing ſo. So likewiſe ſince God invincibly loves himſelf, he cannot but eſteem and love his own Image. And as he loves things in proportion to their being amiable, he cannot but prefer it before all thoſe Beings which either by their nature or corruption are far from re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſembling him.</p>
               <p n="15">XV.
<note place="margin">See the 3. Diſcourſe of the Treatiſe of Nature and Grace.</note> Man is a free Agent, and I ſuppoſe him to have all neceſſary aſſiſtances: In reſpect of Truth, he is capable of ſearching after it notwithſtanding the dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficulty he finds in Meditation; and in reſpect of Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der, he is able to follow it, in ſpite of all the efforts of Concupiſcence. He can ſacrifice his Eaſe to Truth, and his Pleaſures to Order. On the other ſide he can prefer his actual and preſent Happineſs before his Du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, and fall into error and diſorder. In a word, he can deſerve well or ill by doing good or evil. Now God is juſt; he loves his Creatures as they are wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thy of Love, or as they reſemble him. His Will there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore is, that every good action ſhould be rewarded, and every evil one puniſhed; that he who hath made a good uſe of his Liberty, and by that means hath ren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der'd himſelf in part perfect and like God, ſhould be in part happy as he is, and the contrary.</p>
               <p n="16">XVI.
<note place="margin">See the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>marks upon the ſeeming efficacy of ſecond Cauſes, or the 5 and 6 Chriſtian Meditations.</note> It is God alone that acts upon his Creatures; at leaſt he hath a power of acting on them, and can do what he pleaſes with them. He hath power there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore to make ſpiritual Beings happy or miſerable; happy by the enjoyment of Pleaſure, and miſerable by the ſuffering of Pain. He can exalt the juſt and per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect
<pb n="7" facs="tcp:97672:10" rendition="simple:additions"/>above other Men; he can communicate his Pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er to them for the accompliſhment of their deſires, and make them occaſional cauſes for himſelf to act by in a Thouſand manners. He can pull down the wicked, and make them ſubject to the action of the loweſt Beings: This Experience ſufficiently ſhews, for we all, as we are Sinners, depend upon the action of ſenſible objects.</p>
               <p n="17">XVII. He therefore that labours for his Perfection, and endeavours to make himſelf like God, labours for his Happineſs and Advancement. If he doth that which in ſome ſort depends upon himſelf, that is to ſay, if he deſerves well by making himſelf perfect, God will do that which in no ſort depends upon him, in making him happy. For ſince God loves all Beings propor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tionably as they are amiable, and the moſt perfect Beings are the moſt amiable; the moſt perfect Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings ſhall be the moſt powerful, the moſt happy and the moſt contented. He that inceſſantly conſults his Reaſon, and loves Order, having a ſhare in the Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fection of God, ſhall have alſo a ſhare in his Happi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, Glory and Greatneſs.</p>
               <p n="18">XVIII. Man is capable of three Things; Knowing, Loving, and ſenſibly Perceiving; of knowing the true Good, of loving and enjoying it. The knowledge and love of Good are in a great meaſure in his own power, but the enjoyment of it doth not at all depend upon himſelf. Nevertheleſs, ſeeing God is juſt, he that knows and loves him, ſhall alſo enjoy him. God being juſt, muſt of neceſſity give the pleaſure of enjoyment, and by it Happineſs, to him that by a painful application ſeeks the knowledge of the Truth, and by a right uſe of his Liberty and the ſtrength of his Reſolution, conforms himſelf to the Law of God, the immuta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble Order, notwithſtanding all the efforts of Concupi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcence, enduring Pain, deſpiſing Pleaſure, and giving that Honour to his Reaſon, as to believe it upon its Word, and to comfort himſelf with its Promiſes. It is a ſtrange thing! Men know very well that the enjoyment of Pleaſure and avoiding of Pain do not depend immediately on their Deſires: They find on the contrary that it is in their own power to have
<pb n="8" facs="tcp:97672:11" rendition="simple:additions"/>good Thoughts, and to love good Things, that the light of Truth diffuſes it ſelf in them as ſoon as they deſire it, and that the loving and following of Order depends on themſelves.
<note n="*" place="margin">This Age is ſo ill-na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tured or ſo nice, that there are ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>things which it is not ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficient for a Man not to ſay, but he muſt alſo aſſure the World and, that more than once that he doth not ſay them. And therefore my Readers muſt pardon me if I ſeem to di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtruſt their equity.</note> (I ſtill ſuppoſe thoſe ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſary aſſiſtances which are never wanting to thoſe who have Faith, but through their own negligence.) And yet they ſeek after nothing but Pleaſure, and ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>glect the foundation of their eternal Happineſs, that knowledge and love which reſemble the knowledge and love of God, the knowledge of Truth and the love of Order; for as I ſaid before, he that knows Truth and loves Order, knows as God knows and loves as he loves.</p>
               <p n="19">XIX. This then is our firſt and greateſt Duty, that for which God hath created us, the love of which is the Mother of all Vertue, the univerſal, the funda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mental Vertue; the Vertue which makes us juſt and perfect, and which will one Day make us happy. We are rational Creatures; our Vertue and Perfecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on is to love Reaſon, or rather to love Order. For the knowledge of ſpeculative Truths, or relations of Greatneſs doth not regulate our Duties. It is princi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pally the knowledge and love of the relations of Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fection, or practical Truths wherein conſiſt our Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fection. Let us apply our ſelves then to know, to love and follow Order. Let us labour for our Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fection; as for our Happineſs, let us leave that to the diſpoſal of God, on whom it wholly depends. God is juſt, and neceſſarily rewards Vertue: Let us not doubt then but that we ſhall infallibly receive all the Happineſs that we have deſerv'd.</p>
               <p n="20">XX. The Obedience which we pay to Order and ſubmiſſion to the Law of God, is Vertue in all Senſes. Submiſſion to the divine Decrees, or to the power of God is rather Neceſſity than Vertue. A Man may follow Nature, and yet walk irregularly, for Nature it ſelf is irregular. On the other ſide, he may reſiſt the action of God, without oppoſing his Orders; for oftentimes the particular action of God is ſo deter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>min'd by ſecond or occaſional Cauſes, that it is not conformable to Order. It is true indeed that God wills nothing but according to Order; but he often
<pb n="9" facs="tcp:97672:11" rendition="simple:additions"/>acts contrary to it: For Order it ſelf requiring,
<note place="margin">See the 7 and 8 Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtian Medit.</note> that God as the general cauſe, ſhould act in a conſtant and uniform manner according to certain general Laws which he hath eſtabliſh'd, the effects of that cauſe are many times contrary to Order. He forms Monſters, and is ſubſervient as it were to the Wickedneſs of Men in this World, by reaſon of the ſimplicity of thoſe ways by which he executes his Deſigns. So that he who ſhould think to obey God, in ſubmitting to his Power, and in following and obſerving the courſe of Nature, would offend againſt Order, and fall into Diſobedience every Moment.</p>
               <p n="21">XXI. If all the motions of Bodies were caus'd by particular acts of the Will of God, it would be a ſin to avoid the Ruins of a falling Houſe by flight; for we cannot without injuſtice refuſe to render back to God that Life which he hath given us, when he re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quires it again. At this rate it would be an Affront to the Wiſdom of God, to alter the courſe of Rivers, and to turn them to Places that want Water; we ſhould follow the Order of Nature and be quiet. But ſince God acts in conſequence of certain general Laws, we correct his Work, without injuring his Wiſdom: We reſiſt his action, without oppoſing his Will; be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe he doth not will poſitively and directly every thing that he doth. For example, he doth not direct<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly will unjuſt Actions, tho' he alone gives motion to thoſe that commit them: And tho' it be only he who ſends Rain, yet every Man hath a liberty to ſhelter himſelf when it Rains. For God doth not ſend Rain but by a neceſſary conſequence of general Laws; Laws which he hath eſtabliſh'd, not that ſuch or ſuch a Man ſhould be wet through, but for greater ends, and more agreeable to his Wiſdom and Goodneſs. If the Rain fall upon Men, upon the Sea, or upon the Sand, it is becauſe he is not oblig'd to alter the uniformity of his Conduct, for the uſeleſſneſs or inconvenience of the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſequences of it.</p>
               <p n="22">XXII. The caſe is not the ſame between God and Men, between the general cauſe and particulationes. When we oppoſe the action of Men, we offend them; for ſince they act only by particular motions of the
<pb n="10" facs="tcp:97672:12" rendition="simple:additions"/>Will, we cannot reſiſt their action without oppoſing their Deſigns. But when we reſiſt the action of God, we do not at all offend him, nay we often promote his Deſigns: For ſince God conſtantly follows thoſe general Laws which he hath preſcrib'd to himſelf, the combination of thoſe effects which are the neceſſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry conſequences of them, cannot always be conforma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble to Order, nor proper for the execution of his Work. And therefore it is lawful for Men to divert theſe natural effects, not only when they may be the occaſion of their Death, but alſo when they are in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>convenient or diſagreeable. Our Duty then conſiſts in ſubmitting our ſelves to the Law of God, and fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowing Order: For to ſubmit to his abſolute Power is neceſſity. This Order we may know by our union with the Word; ſo that the immutable Order may be our Law and our Guide. But the Divine Decrees are abſolutely unknown to us: And therefore let us not make them our Rule. Let us leave that chimerical Vertue of <hi>following God or Nature,</hi> to the Sages of <hi>Greece</hi> and the Stoicks. But let us conſult Reaſon, let us love and follow Order in all things; for then we truly follow God, when we ſubmit to a Law which he invincibly loves.</p>
               <p n="23">XXIII. But tho' the Order of Nature be not preciſely our Law, and a ſubmiſſion to that Order be by no means a Vertue, we muſt obſerve nevertheleſs that we ought oftentimes to have a regard to it: Yet ſtill this is becauſe the immutable Order ſo requires, and not becauſe the Order of Nature is an effect of the Power of God. A Man that ſuffers Perſecution, or rather one that is tormented with the Gout, is oblig'd to bear it with Patience and Humility, becauſe being a ſinner, Order requires that he ſhould ſuffer, beſides other Reaſons which need not here be produc'd. But if Man were not ſubject to Sin, and the immutable Order did not require that he ſhould ſuffer to deſerve his Reward, certainly he might, nay and ought to ſeek his eaſe, and avoid all ſorts of inconveniences, tho' he were perſecuted, if that were poſſible, by the inclemency of the Seaſons, and by the Miſeries which Sin hath brought into the World. And a Man, tho'
<pb n="11" facs="tcp:97672:12" rendition="simple:additions"/>he be a ſinner, may ſhelter himſelf from the Rain and the Wind, and avoid the action of an avenging God; becauſe Order requires that he ſhould preſerve his Strength and Health, and eſpecially the liberty of his Mind, to think upon his Duty, and ſearch after Truth: And becauſe Rain and Wind being conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quences of the general laws of the Order of Nature, it doth not plainly appear that it is the poſitive Will of God that he ſhould ſuffer that particular inconve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nience. For it would be a hainous Crime in us to avoid the Rain, if God ſhould make it Rain on pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe to wet and puniſh us: As it was in our firſt Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rent to eat of a Fruit, becauſe of the expreſs Prohi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bition, and his formal Diſobedience. But if Vertue conſiſted preciſely in living in that condition where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in we are plac'd in conſequence of the Order of Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, he that is born in the midſt of pleaſure and abun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dance, would be vertuous without pain; and Nature having been happily favourable to him, he would fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low it with pleaſure. But Virtue muſt be painful at preſent, that it may be generous and meritorious. A Man ought to ſacrifice himſelf for the poſſeſſion of God: Pleaſure is the Reward of Merit, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore cannot be the foundation of it, as I ſhall ſhew hereafter. In a Word, Truth it ſelf informs us of one that was commanded to ſell his Goods, and diſtri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bute them to the Poor, if he would be perfect; which was to change his ſtate and condition. Perfection then or Vertue doth not conſiſt in following the Order of Nature, but in ſubmitting wholly to the immutable and neceſſary Order, the inviolable Law of all intelli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gent Beings.</p>

               <head>CHAP. II. <hi>There is no other Vertue but the Love of Order and Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon. Without this Love all Vertues are falſe. We muſt not confound Duties with Vertues We may diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>charge our Duties without Vertue. 'Tis for want of con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſulting Reaſon that Men approve and follow damna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble Cuſtoms.

               </head>
               <p n="1">I. THE Love of Order is not only the chief of all moral Vertues, but the only Vertue: It is the Mother Vertue, the fundamental, univerſal Ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tue; the Vertue which alone makes the Habits or Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſitions of our Minds vertuous. He that beſtows his Goods on the Poor out of Vanity or natural Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paſſion, is not liberal; becauſe it is not Reaſon that guides him, nor Order that governs him, it is no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing but Pride or Mechaniſm. Officers that voluntari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly expoſe themſelves to Dangers are not brave, if it is Ambition that animates them; nor Soldiers, if it is only an abundance of Spirits, and the Fermenta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the Blood. This imaginary noble Ardour, is nothing but Vanity or Clock-work: A little Wine oftentimes is ſufficient to produce a great deal of it. He that bears the Injuries that are offer'd him, many times is neither moderate not patient: 'Tis his Slothfulneſs that makes him immoveable, or his ridicu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lous and ſtoical Bravery that bears him up, and in imagination ſets him above his Enemies: It may be nothing but the diſpoſition of the Machine, want of Spirits, coldneſs of Blood, Melancholy, and perhaps above all ſome contagious Diſtemper of a ſtrong Ima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gination. The ſame may be ſaid of all the other Ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tues. If the love of Order be not the foundation of them, they are falſe and vain, and altogether unbe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>coming a reaſonable Nature, which bears the Image of God himſelf, and hath a communication with him:
<pb n="13" facs="tcp:97672:13" rendition="simple:additions"/>They derive their Original from the Body only; they are not form'd by the Holy Ghoſt, and whoever makes them the Object of his Deſires, and the Foun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dation of his Glory, hath a baſe and abject Mind, a mean Spirit, and a corrupted Heart. But whatever a rebellious Imagination may think, it is not mean nor ſervile to ſubmit to the Law of God himſelf; no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing is more juſt than to be conformable to Order; nothing is more great and noble than to obey God; no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing is more brave and generous than to follow the Party of Reaſon with an unſhaken Conſtancy and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>violable Fidelity, not only when one may follow it with Honour, but then more eſpecially when the cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumſtances of Times and Places are ſuch that one can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not do it without the greateſt Shame and Diſgrace: For he that paſſes for a Fool in following Reaſon, loves Reaſom more than himſelf: But he that follows Order only when it ſhines and ſparkles in the Eyes of the World, ſeeks only Glory; and though he may appear very Glorious in the Eyes of Men, he is an Abomination in the Sight of God.</p>
               <p n="2">II. I know not whether I may be miſtaken or no, but I believe there are abundance of People that do not rightly know what true Vertue is; and even thoſe that have writ of Morality, do not always ſpeak very clearly and exactly of it. It is certain that all thoſe great Names which they give to Vertues and Vices, produce rather confus'd Senſations in the Mind than clear Ideas: But becauſe theſe Senſations affect the Soul, and abſtracted Ideas, tho' clear in themſelves, do not diffuſe their Light but in attentive Minds. Men moſt commonly reſt ſatisfied with theſe words, which pleaſe the Senſes, but leave the Mind in the dark. They fancy that a Diſcourſe the more briskly it ſtrikes upon the Imagination, the more Solid it is; and look upon thoſe exact Reaſonings, which diſappear when Attention is wanting, as Spectres and Illuſions; like Children, who judging of Objects by the Impreſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion they make on their Senſes, imagine that there is more Matter in Ice than in Water; in Gold, and heavy and hard Metals, than in the Air which ſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rounds them almoſt without being felt.</p>
               <pb n="14" facs="tcp:97672:14" rendition="simple:additions"/>
               <p n="3">III. Beſides, whatever is familiar to us doth not ſurpriſe us, we never ſtand to examine it; we think we conceive very well what we have ſaid our ſelves, or heard others ſay a great many times, tho' we have never examin'd it: But the moſt ſolid and evident Truths always create Diſtruſt in us, when they are new. Thus a Word of an obſcure and confus'd Sig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nification, ſeems clear and obvious, how equivocal ſoever it be, if common uſe hath made it current; but a Term which contains nothing equivocal in it, ſeems obſcure and dangerous, if we have never heard it us'd by thoſe Perſons whom we love and eſteem. This is the cauſe that the Terms of Morality are the moſt obſcure and confus'd, and eſpecially thoſe which we look upon as the moſt clear, becauſe they are the moſt common. Every one, for Example, imagines he underſtands very well the Signification of theſe Terms; <hi>Loving, Fearing, Honouring, Charity, Humi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity, Generoſity, Pride, Envy, Self-love;</hi> and if a Man ſhould join clear Ideas to theſe Terms, and to all the Names which are given to Vertues and Vices, beſides that, this ſuppoſes more Knowledge than is generally believ'd, he would certainly take the moſt confus'd and perplex'd way to treat of Morality: For it will appear in the ſequel of this Diſcourſe, that to define theſe Terms rightly, he ought firſt clearly to compre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hend the Principles of that Science, and to be well vers'd in the Knowledge of Human Nature.</p>
               <p n="4">IV. One of the greateſt Defects obſervable in the Moral Writings of ſome Philoſophers, is, that they confound Duties with Vertues, or that they give the name of Vertues to ſimple Duties: So that tho' pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perly there be but one Vertue, to wit, the love of Order, they make an infinite number of them. This is it which cauſes ſuch Confuſion and ſo perplexes that Science, that it is very hard to underſtand throughly what a Man muſt do to be perfectly Good and Ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuous.</p>
               <p n="5">V. It is evident that Vertue ought to render him Vir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuous that poſſeſſes it; and yet a Man may acquit himſelf of his Duty, and with eaſe perform acts of Humility, Generoſity or Liberality without any of
<pb n="15" facs="tcp:97672:14"/>theſe Vertues: So that a diſpoſition or facility of per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forming ſuch Duties is not properly Vertue, without the love of Order. When a Man diſcharges his Duty, he is Vertuous in the Eyes of Men; when he beſtows part of his Goods on his Friend, he appears Liberal and Generous: But Men are not always ſuch as they ſeem to be; and he that never neglects the outward Offices of Friendſhip, but when they are contrary to the inviolable Order, tho' he may ſometimes ſeem guilty of Infidelity, is a truer and more faithful Friend; at leaſt he is a more Vertuous Man and more worthy of Love, than thoſe hot and zealous Friends who Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crifice their Kindred, their Life and their eternal Sal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation to the Paſſions of their Friends.</p>
               <p n="6">VI. We muſt not then confound Vertue with Du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties by reaſon of a ſimilitude of Names; it is this that deceives Men. There are ſome who imagine they follow Vertue, when they follow only a natural In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clination they have to perform ſome certain Duties; and becauſe they are not guided by Reaſon, they are in truth Vicious in exceſs, when they fancy them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves to be Heros in Vertue. But the greateſt part of Mankind, being deceiv'd by this confuſion of Terms and the ſplendour of Names, rely upon, and value them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves without Reaſon, and often judge ill of the moſt Vertuous Perſons; becauſe it is impoſſible that good Men ſhould follow the Rules of Order any long time, without failing according to outward appearance in ſome eſſential Duty. For in ſhort, to be Prudent, Good-natur'd and Charitable in the Eyes of the World, a Man muſt ſometimes commend Vice, or at leaſt hold his Tongue when he hears it commended: To be eſteem'd Liberal, he muſt be Prodigal: If he be not Raſh, he ſhall hardly be accounted Valiant; and if he be not Superſtitious or Credulous, let his Piety be never ſo great, he may perhaps paſs for a Libertine in the Opinion of others.</p>
               <p n="7">VII. It is certain that Univerſal Reaſon is always the ſame, Order is immutable, and yet Morality changes according to Places and Times. It is a Ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tue among the <hi>Germans</hi> to drink hard; and a Man can have no converſation with them if he be not drunk:
<pb n="16" facs="tcp:97672:15"/>It is not Reaſon, but Wine that unites their Societies, ſettles their Agreements, and makes their Bargains. 'Tis reckon'd Bravery in a Gentleman to ſhed the Blood of him that gives him the Lie. Duelling was for a long time a lawful Action amongſt the French; and as if Reaſon was not worthy to determine their Differences, they decided them by Force: They pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fer'd the Law of Brutes or Chance, before the Law of God himſelf. Nor muſt we imagine that this Cu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtom was in uſe only amongſt the Men of the Sword, it was in a manner general; and if the Clergy did not fight themſelves out of reſpect to their Character, they had their Champions who repreſented them, and maintain'd their Quarrel by ſhedding the Blood of their Adverſaries: Nay, they imagin'd that God approv'd this manner of proceeding; and whether their Dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferences were decided by the Sword or by Lot, they did not doubt but that God ſat as Judge in the Cauſe, and gave it in favour of him that had Right on his ſide. And indeed, if we ſuppoſe God to act by par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular wills, where is the Impiety of believing, either that he favours Injuſtice, or that his Providence doth not extend to all things?</p>
               <p n="8">VIII. But without going to ſeek for damnable Cu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtoms in the paſt Ages, let any one, by the Light of Reaſon, judge of thoſe that are at preſent kept up a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong us; or let him only obſerve the Conduct of thoſe very Perſons who are appointed for Guides to others. Without doubt, we ſhall often find that every one of them hath his particular Morality, his own private Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion, and his favourite Vertue; that one talks of nothing but Penance and Mortification; another eſteems only the Duties of Charity; and a third cries up nothing but Meditation and Prayer. From whence can this diverſity proceed, if the Reaſon of Man be always the ſame? From hence no doubt, that they leave off conſulting Reaſon, and ſuffer themſelves to be guided by Imagination, its Enemy; in ſtead of ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerving the immutable Order, as their inviolable and natural Law, they frame to themſelves Ideas of Ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tue, conformable at leaſt in ſome things to their own Inclinations. For there are ſome Vertues, or rather
<pb n="17" facs="tcp:97672:15"/>Duties, which have a relation to our Tempers or Hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mours; there are ſhining and glittering Vertues proper for fierce and lofty Souls; low and humble Vertues which are fit for timorous and fearful Minds, and ſoft and effeminate Vertues, if I may ſo call them, which ſuit very well with Lazineſs and Inactivity.</p>
               <p n="9">IX. It is true, they agree that Order is the invio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lable Law of Spiritual Beings, and that nothing is regu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar, if it be not conformable to it. But they maintain a little too ſtifly, that they are not capable of conſulting this Law; and tho' it be graven upon the Heart of Man, ſo that he need only retire into himſelf to be in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtructed in it, they think, like the groſs and carnal <hi>Jews,</hi> that it is as hard to diſcover it, as to climb up into Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven, or go down into Hell, as the Scripture ſpeaks.</p>
               <p n="10">X. I muſt confeſs, that the immutable Order is not eaſie to be found; it dwells within us, but we are al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ways roving abroad: Our Senſes unite our Soul to all the parts of our Body, our Imagination and Paſſions extend it to all the Objects which ſurround us, and of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten carry it into a World that hath no more reality than imaginary Spaces; this is undeniably ſo: But then we ſhould endeavour to ſilence our Senſes, Imagination and Paſſions; and not fancy that we can be reaſonable with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out conſulting Reaſon. But this Order by which we ought to be govern'd, is a Form too abſtracted to ſerve as a Model for groſſer Spirits; I grant it: Let us then give it a Body, let us make it ſenſible, let us cloath it in ſeveral Dreſſes to render it agreeable to carnal Men; let us, if I may ſo ſpeak, incarnate it, yet ſo as it may be always known again. Let us accuſtom Men to di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtinguiſh true Vertue from Vice, from ſeeming Vertues, and from ſimple Duties, which a Man may often per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>form without Vertue, and not ſet before them Phantoms or Idols, which attract their Admiration and Reſpect, by the ſenſible Splendour and Pomp that ſurrounds them. For in ſhort, if we are not guided by Reaſon, if we are not animated by the Love of Order, how exact ſoever we may be in the performance of our Duties, we can never be ſolidly Vertuous.</p>
               <p n="11">XI. But, ſay they, Reaſon is corrupted, it is liable to Error, it muſt ſubmit to Faith: Philoſophy is but a Servant, we ought to diſtruſt the Light which that af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fords.
<pb n="18" facs="tcp:97672:16"/>(All equivocal Terms.) Man is not his own Light: Religion is the true Philoſophy. It is not, I confeſs, the Philoſophy of the Heathens, nor that of thoſe great Talkers, who ſpeak to others before Truth has ſpoke to them. Reaſon is immutable, incorruptible, infallible, and ought always to govern; God himſelf follows it. In a word, we ought never to ſhut our Eyes againſt the Light; but we ſhould accuſtom our ſelves to diſtinguſh it from Darkneſs or falſe Glares, from con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fus'd Senſations, from ſenſible Idea's, which appear bright and ſhining Lights to thoſe who are not accu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtom'd to diſtinguiſh Truth from Probability, Evidence from Inſtinct, and Reaſon from its Enemy, Imagination. Certainly Underſtanding is preferable to Faith; for Faith will have an end, but Underſtanding will remain for ever. Faith is, indeed, a very great good; but it is becauſe it leads to Underſtanding, and without it we cannot deſerve the Underſtanding of ſome neceſſary and eſſential Truths, without which it is impoſſible to at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain either to ſolid Vertue or everlaſting Happineſs: Nevertheles, Faith without Underſtanding, I ſpeak not here of Myſteries of which we can have no clear Idea; Faith, I ſay, without any Light, if that be poſſible, can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not make a Man ſolidly Vertuous: It is the Light which perfects the Mind and regulates the Heart; and if Faith did not enlighten a Man and lead him to ſome Under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding of the Truth, and ſome Knowledge of his Duty, without doubt it would not have thoſe Effects which are attributed to it. But Faith is a Term as equivocal as that of Reaſon, Philoſophy, and human Sciences.</p>
               <p n="12">XII. I grant then, that thoſe who have not Light enough to guide themſelves, may attain to Vertue, as well as thoſe who can retire into themſelves to conſult Reaſon, and contemplate the Beauty of Order; becauſe the Grace of Senſe or preventing delectation, may ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ply the want of Light, and keep them firm and ſtedfaſt in their Duty. But that which I maintain, is, Firſt, That ſuppoſing all other things equal, he that enters fartheſt into himſelf, and hearkens to the Truth within him in the greateſt ſilence of his Senſes, Imagination and Paſſions, is the moſt ſolidly Vertuous. Secondly, That ſuch a Love of Order as hath for its Foundation more of Reaſon than of Faith, that is, more of Light
<pb n="19" facs="tcp:97672:16"/>than of Pleaſure, is more ſolid, meritorious and valuable, than another Love which I ſuppoſe equal. For indeed, the true good, the good of the Soul ſhould be lov'd by Reaſon, and not by the inſtinct of Pleaſure. But the condition to which Sin hath reduc'd us, makes the Grace of Delight neceſſary to counterpoiſe the continual endeavours of our Concupiſcence. Laſtly, I aſſert, That if a Man ſhould never, I ſay, never retire into himſelf, his imaginary Faith would be wholly uſeleſs to him. For the Word became ſenſible, only to render Truth intelligible. Reaſon was made incarnate for no other end, but to guide Men to Reaſon by their Senſes; and he that ſhould do and ſuffer all that Jeſus Chriſt did and ſuffer'd, would be neither reaſonable nor a Chriſtian, if he did it not in the Spirit of Chriſt, the Spirit of Order and Reaſon. But there is no cauſe to fear this; for it is abſolutely impoſſible, that any Man ſhould be ſo far ſeparated from Reaſon, as never to retire into himſelf to conſult it. And tho' there are many People who perhaps know not what it is to retire into them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves, yet it is impoſſible but that they muſt do it ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times, and muſt ſometimes hear the Voice of Truth, notwithſtanding the continual Noiſe of their Senſes and Paſſions: It is impoſſible but that they muſt have ſome Idea of Order, and ſome Love for it, which without doubt they cannot have but from ſomething which dwells in them, and renders them ſo far juſt and reaſonable; for no Man is himſelf the ground of his Love, nor the Spirit that inſpires, animates and guides it.</p>
               <p n="13">XIII. Every Man pretends to Reaſon, and yet every Man renounces it. This may ſeem a Contradiction; but there is nothing more true: Every Man pretends to Reaſon, becauſe every Man hath this engraven on the very Foundation of his Being, that it is an eſſential Right of human Nature, to have a ſhare of Reaſon. But all Men renounce Reaſon, becauſe they cannot unite themſelves to it, and receive from it Light and Under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding, without a ſort of Labour which is very diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>couraging, becauſe it hath nothing that pleaſes the Senſes. And therefore ſince they invincibly deſire to be happy, they quit the Labour of Attention, which renders them actu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally unhappy; but yet when they quit it, they com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monly fancy they do it by Reaſon. The voluptuous
<pb n="20" facs="tcp:97672:17"/>Man thinks he ought to prefer the actual Enjoyment of Pleaſures before a barren and abſtracted View of Truth, which coſts him nevertheleſs abundance of Pains. The ambitious Man imagines that the object of his Paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion is ſomething real, and that intellectual Enjoyments are nothing but Phantoms and Illuſions; for commonly Men judge of the Solidity of good things by the Impreſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion they make on the Imagination and Senſes. Nay, there are ſome Perſons of Piety, who prove by Reaſon, That we ought to renounce Reaſon; That we are not to be guided by Light, but by Faith alone; and that blind Obedience is the principal Vertue of a Chriſtian. The Lazineſs of Inferiours, and their proneſs to Flatter, is often ſatisfied with this fancied Vertue, and the Pride of Superiours is always very well pleas'd with it: So that perhaps there may be ſome Perſons, who will be of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fended with me, for giving ſo great an Honour to Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon, as to ſet it above all other Powers; and think me a Rebel againſt lawful Authorities, becauſe I take the part of Reaſon, and maintain that it belongs to Reaſon to decide and govern. But let the Voluptuous follow their Senſes; let the Ambitious ſuffer themſelves to be carried away by their Paſſions; let the generality of Mankind live by Opinion, or follow wherever their own Imaginations lead them: But let us endeavour to ſtill that confus'd Noiſe which ſenſible Objects cauſe in us; let us retire into our ſelves, and conſult the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward Truth, yet let us take great care not to confound its Anſwers with the malignant Influences of our cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rupted Imagination. For it is better, infinitely better for a Man to obey the Paſſions of thoſe who have a right to command and guide him, than to be wholly his own Maſter, to follow his own Paſſions, and voluntarily to blind himſelf, by aſſuming ſuch an Air of Confidence in Error, as only the diſcovery of Truth ought to give him. I have elſewhere laid down the Rules which we ought to obſerve for avoiding this Miſcarriage; but I ſhall ſay ſomething of it alſo in this Diſcourſe, for with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out this, we cannot be ſolidly and rationally Vertuous.</p>

                  <q>Tho' I ſpake all Languages, even that of Angels themſelves, yet if I had not Charity. I ſhould be but like ſounding Braſs, or a tinkling Cymbal.</q> The ways of Speaking are different according to the diverſity of Perſons ſpoken to. The Scripture which is written for all the World, expreſſes the Truths it contains, in ſuch Terms only as are authoris'd by the moſt common Uſe. But he that would convince and inform the moſt obſtinate Perſons, I mean thoſe Men of ſtrong Reaſon as they fancy them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves, and thoſe whom they call Philoſophers, People that find difficulties in every Thing, muſt endeavour to explain his Sentiments by Terms that as far as may be are free from an equivocal Signification.</p>
               <p n="2">II. Theſe Words, [<hi>Thou ſhalt Love God with all thy Strength, and thy Neighbour as thy Self</hi>] are clear, but it
<pb n="22" facs="tcp:97672:18"/>is chiefly to thoſe who are inwardly Taught by the Unction of the Spirit: For as to others, they are more obſcure than is commonly imagin'd. To <hi>[Love]</hi> is an equivocal Term: It ſignifies two Things among many others, Firſt, to unite our ſelve by the Will to any ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject as to our Good, or the cauſe of our Happineſs; and Secondly to wiſh Well to any one. We may love God in the firſt Senſe, and our Neighbour in the Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond. But it would be Impiety, or at leaſt Stupidity or Ignorance to love God in the latter Senſe, and a kind of Idolatry to love our Neighbour in the for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer.</p>
               <p n="3">III. The word <hi>[God]</hi> is likewiſe Equivocal, and much more than it is thought to be: A Man may fancy he loves God, when indeed he loves only a vaſt immenſe Phantom which he hath form'd to himſelf. He may think he loves God when at the ſame time he lives in Diſorder, or without loving Order above all Things. But he is miſtaken; for he is ſo far from loving him, that he doth not ſo much as know him.
<note place="margin">1 <hi>Joh.</hi> 2.4, 5.</note> For <hi>he that ſaith, I know him, and keepeth not his Commandments, is a Lier, and the Truth is not in him: But whoſo keepeth his Word, in him verily is the love of God perfected,</hi> or he perfectly loves God,
<note place="margin">v. 3.</note> ſaith St. <hi>John. Hereby we do know that we know him, if we keep his Commandments.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="4">IV. <hi>Thou ſhalt love the Lord thy God with all thy Strength.</hi> The word <hi>[all]</hi> is clear enough; but <hi>[thy Strength]</hi> may Miniſter occaſion of Error to thoſe who either have no Humility, or a falſe and miſtaken one. The former may draw from it ſome ground of Vanity, and the latter of a ſinful Negligence. <hi>[And thy Neighbour as thy ſelf.]</hi> Our Saviour tells us in the Parable of the <hi>Samaritan,</hi> that all Mankind is our Neighbour. So that the word <hi>[Neighbour]</hi> is not very clear; and ſo we find the <hi>Jews</hi> always took it in a wrong Senſe. <hi>[As thy ſelf.]</hi> Certainly there are none but thoſe that love the true and real good, who fulfil this Commandment in loving their Neighbour as themſelves. For a Father who loves his Son with the greateſt Tenderneſs, and carefully procures for him all ſenſible good Things, what love ſoever he may have for him, is very far from loving him as God commands us to love our Neigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bour.</p>
               <pb n="23" facs="tcp:97672:18"/>
               <p n="5">V. Theſe words then, <hi>[Thou ſhalt love the Lord thy God,</hi> &amp;c.] are obſcure: But in Truth they are obſcure only to thoſe who have a mind to Diſpute, or who will not retire into themſelves, to behold this Commandment written there with the Finger of God: The Holy Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture is a clos'd Book only to thoſe who are not in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtructed by the unction of the Spirit. For pious Men tho' never ſo Dull and Stupid, underſtand this Precept very well. They know that all the application of our Mind, and all the motions of our Heart ought to tend toward God; that we ſhould employ our Thoughts on nothing but him, as far as it is poſſible: That we do not truly Love him, if we are not nice and exact in doing our Duty: And that to violate the order of Juſtice, or the immutable Order, is in effect to offend againſt the Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine Majeſty. They are ſo far from loving Men as capable of doing them Good, that they are afraid to come near great Perſons, and are only pleas'd to be amongſt thoſe who ſtand in need of their Aſſiſtance. They love Men not as their Good, nor as capable of enjoying tranſitory Goods with them, Goods which only ſerve to cauſe diviſion every where: But they Love them as Co-heirs of the true Goods; true Goods, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe they are poſſeſs'd without diviſion, enjoy'd with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out ſatiety, and lov'd without any fear of loſing them, like the Pleaſures of this preſent Life. The Father loves his Son; but he had rather ſee him Deform'd than Diſorderly. He had rather ſee him Sick, Dead, or at the Gallows, than ſee him Dead in the Eyes of him, who never had a more agreable Sight than that of his only Son faſten'd to the Croſs to re-eſtabliſh Order in the World. Pious Men underſtand the Law of God, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe they are inſtructed by the ſame Spirit that dictated it. But becauſe this Diſcourſe is intended chiefly for Philoſophers, and it lies not in my Power to communi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cate that holy Unction which produces Light in the Minds of Men; I think my ſelf oblig'd to endeavour to prove by Reaſon, and explain as far as I am able in clear Terms, thoſe Truths of which perhaps they are not ſufficiently Convinc'd.</p>
               <p n="6">VI. I think then I may ſay, that juſtifying Charity, or that Vertue which renders the poſſeſſors of it truly Juſt and Vertuous, is properly a <hi>ruling Love of the im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mutable
<pb n="24" facs="tcp:97672:19"/>Order.</hi> But that I may clear thoſe Obſcurities which ordinarily attend abſtract Ideas, I muſt explain theſe Terms a little more at large.</p>
               <p n="7">VII. I have already ſaid that the immutable Order conſiſts in nothing elſe but in thoſe proportions or rela<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions of Perfection which are between the intellectual Ideas comprehended in the ſubſtance of the eternal Word. Now we ought to eſteem and love nothing but Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fection. And therefore our eſteem and love ſhould be conformable to Order. From hence it is evident that Charity or the love of God, is a conſequence of the love of Order, and that we ought to eſteem and love God not only more, but infinitely more than all other Things; for there can be no finite relation between in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>finite and finite.</p>
               <p n="8">VIII. There are Two principal kinds of Love, a Love of <hi>Benevolence,</hi> and a Love which may be call'd Love of <hi>
                     <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>nion.</hi> A ſenſual Man Loves the object of his Paſſion with a Love of <hi>
                     <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>nion;</hi> becauſe he looks upon that Object as the cauſe of his Happineſs, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore he deſires to be united to it, that it may act upon him and make him Happy. He is carried towards it as well by the motion of his Heart, or by his Affections, as by the motion of his Body. The Love which we bear to Perſons of Worth and Merit, is a love of <hi>Bene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>volence;</hi> for we love them even when they are not in a condition to do us any good: We Love them becauſe they have more <hi>Perfection</hi> and <hi>Vertue</hi> than other Men. So that the power to do us Good, or that kind of per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fection which relates to our Happineſs; in one Word, <hi>Goodneſs</hi> excites in us a love of <hi>
                     <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>nion,</hi> and all other perfections a love of <hi>Benevolence.</hi> Now God only is <hi>Good:</hi> He alone hath the <hi>Power</hi> of acting on us. He doth not really communicate that Perfection to his Creatures; but only makes them occaſional Cauſes for the producing of ſome Effects: For true and real Pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er is Incommunicable. Therefore all our love of Union ought to tend toward God.</p>
               <pb n="25" facs="tcp:97672:19"/>
               <p n="9">IX. We may, for Inſtance, <hi>bring</hi> our Body to the Fire, becauſe Fire is the <hi>occaſional</hi> cauſe of Heat, which is neceſſary for it: But we cannot <hi>love</hi> it with a love of <hi>
                     <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>nion,</hi> without offending againſt Order; becauſe the Fire is ſo far from having any power over that part of us which is capable of Loving, that it hath no Power at all. The ſame may be ſaid of all other Creatures, even Angels and Devils; we ought to love none of them with a Love of Union, with that Love which is an Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour given to Power; for all of them being abſolutely impotent, we ſhould by no means love them. When I ſpeak of loving, I mean alſo fearing and hating them; I mean that the Soul ſhould remain unmov'd in their Preſence. The Body by a local Motion may come near the Fire, or avoid the Fall of a Houſe; but the Soul muſt fear and love nothing but God; at leaſt, it muſt love none but him, with a love of Freedom, Choice and Reaſon: For ſince the Union of the Soul and Body is chang'd into a dependance, it is hardly in our power to hinder ſenſible Goods from exciting in us ſome love for them. The motions of the Soul naturally an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwer thoſe of the Body; and the Object which makes us fly from it, or attracts us to it, almoſt always begets in us Averſion or Love.</p>
               <p n="10">X. But the Caſe is not the ſame with the Love of Benevolence, as with the Love of Union; God is in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>finitely more amiable with this ſort of Love, than all his Creatures together: But as he hath really commu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nicated to them ſome Perfection, as they are capable of Happineſs, they really deſerve our Love and Eſteem. Order it ſelf requires that we ſhould eſteem and love them according to the meaſure of Perfection which they enjoy, or rather according to that which we know to be in them: For to eſteem and love them exactly in pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portion to their being amiable, is utterly impoſſible; becauſe many times their Perfections are unknown to us, and we can never know exactly the proportions that are between Perfections; for we cannot expreſs them either by Numbers, or incommenſurable Lines. Ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vertheleſs, Faith takes away a great many difficulties in this matter. For ſince a finite Being by the relation it hath to infinity, acquires an infinite Value; it is evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent that we ought to love thoſe Creatures which have,
<pb n="26" facs="tcp:97672:20"/>or may have a great relation to God, infinitely more, than thoſe which do not bear his Image, or which have no immediate union with, or relation to him: It is plain that all other things being equal, one righteous Man, one member of Jeſus Chriſt deſerves more of this kind of Love, than a thouſand wicked Men; and that God who judges truly and exactly of the Value of his Creatures, prefers one of his adopted Children, before all the Nations of the Earth.</p>
               <p n="11">XI. It is certain, that our Duties ought to be regu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lated by the Love of Eſteem or Benevolence; but yet we muſt not imagine that we always owe more Duties to righteous Men than to Sinners, to the Faithful than to Hereticks, or even Heathens themſelves. For we muſt obſerve, that there are Perfections of ſeveral ſorts, ſome Perſonal or Abſolute, and others Relative: Perſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal Perfections ought to be the immediate Object of the Love of Eſteem and Benevolence; but relative Perfe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctions do not deſerve either this or any other kind of Love, but only the Object to which theſe Perfections have a relation. We ſhould love and honour Merit where-ever we find it, for Merit is a perſonal Perfection which ought to regulate our Love of Eſteem and Bene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>volence; but it ought not always to regulate the great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs and quality of our Duties. On the contrary, we owe a great many Duties to our Prince, to our Parents, and to all thoſe that are in Authority; for Authority is neceſſary for the preſervation of Order in States, which is the moſt valuable thing in the World: But the Honour which we pay to them, the Love which we bear them ought to terminate in God alone:
<note place="margin">Coloſ. 3.23.</note> As to the Lord, and not unto Men, ſaith St. <hi>Paul.</hi> The Honour which we give to Power muſt be refer'd to God and not to Men; for the power of Acting is in God alone. In like manner, if a Man have ſuch natural endowments as may be ſerviceable for the Converſion of others, tho' he have no perſonal Merit or Vertue, we ought to love him with a love of Eſteem which hath a relation to ſomething elſe; and we are oblig'd to many more Duties towards him, than towards another Man who hath a great deal of perſonal Merit, but is not capable of being uſeful to any but himſelf. But I ſhall explain this matter-more at large in another place; what I have ſaid of it here, is
<pb n="27" facs="tcp:97672:20"/>only to prevent the Reader from running inſenſibly whi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther I have no deſign to lead him.</p>
               <p n="12">XII. Self-Love, the irreconcileable Enemy of Vertue, or a ruling Love of the immutable Order, may agree with the Love of Union, which is refer'd to, and ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nours a Power capable of acting on us; for it is ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficient for that purpoſe, that this Self-love be enlightned. Man invincibly deſires to be happy; and he ſees clearly that God alone is able to make him ſo: This being ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pos'd and all the reſt excluded, of which I do not ſpeak, it is evident that he may deſire to be united to God. For to take away every thing that may be equivocal, I do not ſpeak of a Man who knows that God rewards only Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit, and who finds none in himſelf; but I ſpeak of one who conſiders only the Power and Goodneſs of God, or one to whom the Teſtimony of his Conſcience and his Faith give a free acceſs, as I may ſo ſay, to draw near to God, and join himſelf to him.</p>
               <p n="13">XIII. But the caſe is different with the Love of Eſteem or Benevolence which a Man ought to bear to himſelf; Self-love makes it always irregular. Order requires that the Reward ſhould be proportionable to the Merit, and the Happineſs to the Perfection of the Soul, which it hath gain'd by a good uſe of its Liberty; but Self-love can endure no bounds to its Happineſs and Glory. Tho' it be never ſo much enlightned, yet if it be not juſt, it muſt of neceſſity be contrary to Order; and it cannot be juſt without diminiſhing or deſtroying it ſelf. Nevertheleſs, when Self-love is both enlightned and juſt, whether it be deſtroy'd by, or confounded with the Love of Order, a Man hath then the greateſt Perfection that he is capable of. For certainly he that always places himſelf in the rank that belongs to him, who deſires to be Happy no farther than he deſerves to be ſo, and ſeeks his Happineſs in the Juſtice which he expects from the righteous Judge; who lives by Faith, and reſts contented, ſtedfaſt and patient in the hope and foretaſt of the true Goods; he, I ſay, is really a good Man, tho' the love he bears to himſelf re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>form'd indeed and corrected by Grace, be the na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tural Foundation of his Love of Order above all Things.</p>
               <pb n="28" facs="tcp:97672:21"/>
               <p n="14">XIV. We muſt not imagine that the love of Order is like thoſe Vertues, or rather particular Diſpoſitions which may be loſt or got. For Order is not a particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar Creature which we may begin or ceaſe to love; it is the Word it ſelf, the natural Object of all the Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions of Spiritual Beings. We may begin or ceaſe to love a Creature, becauſe we are not made for them; but we cannot entirely renounce Reaſon, nor ceaſe to love Order; becauſe Man is made to live by Reaſon, and according to Order: So that the love of Order na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turally Reigns where-ever Self-love is not contrary to it. Nay, it often Reigns, tho' Self-love or Concupiſcence oppoſe it; I ſay, it Reigns not only in good Men, where it hath an abſolute Dominion, but alſo in the wicked, where Self-love bears the Sovereign ſway.</p>
               <p n="15">XV. It is certain that a Man ſees only as he is en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lightned by God; he wills only as he is animated and moved by him. Now God enlightnes him only by his Word, he moves him only by the Love which he bears to himſelf: For God cannot enlighten Man by a falſe Reaſon, nor imprint on him a Love contrary to his own. All Light therefore comes from the Word, and all Motion from the Holy Ghoſt, ſeeing it is God alone that acts, and that only by the Wiſdom which enlightens him, and the Love which he bears to himſelf. So that as long as a Man Thinks and Loves, he cannot be to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tally ſeparated from Reaſon, nor altogether without the love of Order. To fall into Error, he muſt make an ill uſe of Reaſon; but ſtill he muſt make uſe of it; for he that ſees nothing, and can judge of nothing, cannot fall into Error. In like manner to love Evil, he muſt love Good; for he cannot love Evil, but becauſe he looks upon it as Good. Therefore Self-love doth not wholly deſtroy the Love of Order, but only Vitiates and Corrupts it, by referring that to its ſelf which hath no relation to it. For a Man, whether he loves the Objects with a relation to himſelf, or otherwiſe, al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ways loves thoſe that are or ſeem to be the beſt; be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe the love of Order, or the love of good things pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portionable to their Perfection or Goodneſs, is a natural and invincible Love.</p>
               <p n="16">XVI. This I ſay principally, That the Wicked may at leaſt know themſelves to be ſuch, and the Righteous
<pb n="29" facs="tcp:97672:21"/>may diſtruſt their Vertue. For ſince Men, tho' they are never ſo wretched and miſerable, find in themſelves ſome rectitude or ſome natural love of Order, they imagine that they are really Vertuous. But to obtain the poſſeſſion of Vertue, it is not ſufficient that we love Order with a natural Love, but we muſt alſo love it with a free, enlightned and reaſonable Love. It is not ſufficient to love it, when it agrees with our Self-love. We muſt Sacrifice every thing to it, our actual Happi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, and if it ſhould require it of us, our very Being. For Vertue conſiſts in a ruling Love of the immutable Order. Our Heart is never rightly diſpoſed, but when it is ready to conform it ſelf to Order in all things; and he that would have Order conformable in ſome things to his particular Inclinations, hath a perverted Mind and a corrupt Heart. There is no Man, let him be never ſo Wicked, who doth not ſometimes find a beau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty in Order that charms him. In all probability the Devils themſelves have ſome Love for Order. They are ready to obey it, when it requires nothing of them contrary to their Self-love: And perhaps ſome of them would willingly offer ſome ſlight Sacrifice to it. They are not all equally Wicked; and therefore they do not all equally oppoſe Order. <hi>Judas</hi> was a Wretch govern'd by Avarice; yet it is reaſonable to believe that to deli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver his beſt Friend from Death, he would have Sacri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficed a little Mony. He Sold our Saviour for thirty Pieces of Silver, but perhaps he would not have betray'd him for a leſs Sum. So then to be Vertuous, it is not ſufficient to love Order, but we muſt love it more than all other things: We muſt have a firm Reſolution to follow it every where, whatever it coſt us. We muſt be ready to Sacrifice to it not a few inconſiderable Plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſures, or ſlight Pains, but our Happineſs, our Reputa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, and our very Being, in hopes of receiving from God a recompence befitting him to give.</p>
               <p n="17">XVII. But beſides all this I muſt add, that a ſimple Reſolution, tho' never ſo ſtrong, of following Order in all things, doth not juſtify us in the fight of God. For God, who makes a true Judgment of the diſpoſitions of our Minds, doth not judge any ſoul according to its actual and tranſient Motions, but by that which is fix'd and permanent in it. Simple acts are tranſient: And a Man that finds
<pb n="30" facs="tcp:97672:22"/>himſelf throughly affected with the Beauty of Order, and thereupon takes a holy Reſolution of Sacrificing all other things to it, ought ſtill to be in fear for himſelf. For it ſcarce ever happens that one ſingle act produces the ſtrongeſt Habit, and that the actual motion of the Soul, deſtroys an inveterate Diſpoſition of obeying the incli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nations of Self-love. On the contrary Habits are per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manent; and tho' a juſt Man fall ſeven times a Day, let him comfort himſelf, God knows the bottom of his Heart. But let him take heed that he be not ſeduc'd and corrupted by Concupiſcence, and that his imagina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion receiving dangerous Impreſſions every Moment from ſenſible Objects, do not ſome time or other openly rebel againſt thoſe ſevere Laws which are ſo damping and diſagreeable to it. For we muſt obſerve that the Habit of Charity is much more tender, and more diffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cult both to acquire and preſerve than ſinful Habits: For one ſingle deliberate Act, one mortal Sin always deſtroys it. A Man is juſt in the ſight of God when his Heart is really more diſpos'd to love good than evil, with a free and rational Love, whether this diſpoſition be acquir'd by free and rational acts of Love, or other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe. But becauſe we know only that which actually paſſes in our Soul, and Charity doth not diſcover it ſelf ſenſibly as Concupiſcence doth, we cannot be aſſur'd of the ſtate we are in. Therefore we ought always to di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtruſt our ſelves without deſponding, and to Labour even till Death to deſtroy Self-love and Concupiſcence, which continually renews it ſelf, and to fortify the love of Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der, which is weakned or deſtroy'd when we ceaſe to keep a watch over our ſelves.</p>
               <p n="18">XVIII. For the right underſtanding of what follows, we muſt obſerve that the acts of Love are of two ſorts; natural or purely voluntary Acts, and free Acts. All Pleaſure infallibly produces in the Soul the natural mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of Love, or makes us love the Object which cauſes or ſeems to cauſe that Pleaſure, with a natural, neceſſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry or purely voluntary Love. But every Pleaſure doth not produce a free Love; for free Love is not always conformable to the natural Love. This Love doth not depend upon Pleaſure alone; but upon Reaſon, upon Liberty, upon the Power which the Soul hath to reſiſt any Motion that preſſes it. It is the conſent of the Will
<pb n="31" facs="tcp:97672:22"/>which makes the eſſential difference of this ſpecies of Love. Now theſe two different acts of Love produce two different Habits. The natural Love begets in the Soul a diſpoſition toward natural Love: And the love of Choice leaves in it a Habit of that Love. For when a Man hath conſented ſeveral times to the love of any Good, he hath an inclination or facility to conſent to it again.</p>
               <p n="19">XIX. We muſt know then, that every diſpoſition of Love, whether natural or free, corrupts the Soul, and renders it odious to God, if the object of it be a Crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture; but if it be applied to the Creator, it makes the Soul righteous and acceptable to God: Provided never<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>theleſs that the diſpoſition of natural Love be alone in the Heart; for if there be two Habits of Love of different kinds in the Heart, God doth not regard the natural Love, but only that which is free.</p>
               <p n="20">XX. For Example, an Infant at his firſt coming into the World is a Sinner and deſerves the wrath of God, becauſe God loves Order, and the Heart of that Infant is irregular, or turn'd toward the Body by an habitual diſpoſition of a natural, neceſſary, or merely voluntary Love
<note n="†" place="margin">See <hi>l.</hi> 2. <hi>c.</hi> 1. of the Search after Truth, and the Notes upon that Chap.</note> which he derives from his Parents, without any conſent on his part. <hi>Adam</hi> at the firſt inſtant of his Crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion was Juſt, becauſe his Heart was diſpos'd to love God, tho' he had not as yet acquir'd a habit of conſent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to that Love. So that a natural diſpoſition or habit when it is alone, corrupts or juſtifies the Soul. For when there is but one habitual Love in the Heart, if that love be Good, there is nothing in it but what is amiable in the Eyes of him who loves Order; and the contrary, if that Love be evil. But when there are two habits of Love of different kinds, God hath no regard but to that which is free. It is probable that the Juſt have a much greater facility and natural diſpoſition to love the Goods of the Body than the true and real ones. The Pleaſures of Senſe being almoſt continually before them, and the preventing delight of Grace much more rare, they are more ſtrongly diſpoſs'd by this ſort of Ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bit, which is a natural conſequence of Pleaſure, to love ſenſible Objects than the true Good. This is evident by what happens to them in Sleep, or when they are not upon their Guard, but act without Reflection: For
<pb n="32" facs="tcp:97672:23"/>then they moſt commonly follow the motions of Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cupiſcence. But theſe irregularities do not corrupt them, becauſe the Habit of Vertue is not chang'd; for thoſe acts which are not free, cannot change free Ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bits, but only the Habits of the ſame kind. From what hath been ſaid it is plain, that the love of Order which juſtifies us in the ſight of God, muſt be an habitual, free and ruling Love of the immutable Order. And therefore where I ſpeak of the love of Order in the ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quel of this Diſcourſe, I generally underſtand by it this kind of habitual Love, and not an actual not an habi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tual natural Love, not a love which is not predominant, nor any other motion or diſpoſition of the Soul.</p>

THat I may give a clear explication of the means of acquiring or preſerving the ruling Love of the immutable Order, I ſhall lay down two fundamental Truths belonging to the firſt Part of this Treatiſe. Firſt, that Vertues are generally acquir'd and fortified by Acts. Secondly, that when we act, we do not al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ways produce the acts of the ruling Vertue: What I ſay of Vertue, muſt be alſo underſtood of all Habits good or bad, and even of the Paſſions which are natural to us.</p>
               <p n="2">II. Every one is ſufficiently convinc'd by his own Experience, that thoſe Habits which have a relation to the Body are form'd and preſerv'd by Acts. Thus it is univerſally agreed, that by the acts of Dancing, Playing
<pb n="33" facs="tcp:97672:23"/>on an Inſtrument or ſpeaking a Language, thoſe Habits may be acquir'd. Moſt People are perſuaded that Men get a Habit of Drunkenneſs by drinking much; that the company of Women makes a Man ſoft and effemi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nate, and that thoſe who converſe with Souldiers be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come generally Stout or Brutiſh. But there are few who ſeriouſly conſider, that the Soul it ſelf by its own Acts gets ſuch Habits, as it cannot eaſily get rid of. A Mathematician is apt to imagine, that it is in his own power not to love the Mathematicks, and to give over the Study of them: An ambitious Man fooliſhly per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſuades himſelf that he is not a ſlave to his Paſſion: And every one believes, that tho' he be in a miſerable ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jection to ſome vitious Habit, he is able whenever he pleaſes to break the Chains that hold him in Captivity. It is upon this Principle that Men ſtill delay their Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſion; for ſeeing there is nothing more requir'd to Converſion, than to deſpiſe thoſe Enjoyments which they own to be vain and contemptible, and to love God, who certainly alone deſerves to be lov'd; every one per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſuades himſelf that he hath, and always ſhall have Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon and Strength enough to form and put in Execution a Deſign ſo juſt and reaſonable.</p>
               <p n="3">III. Beſides, as the Will is never forc'd, we imagine that whatſoever we will, we will juſt ſo only becauſe we will. We do not conſider that the acts of the Will are produc'd in us, in conſequence of our inward Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſitions; which Diſpoſitions being in truth certain modifications of our own proper Being, but unknown to us, cauſe us to will in ſuch a manner, that this Vo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lition ſeems to depend wholly on our ſelves; for we will ſo freely and readily, that we think nothing obliges us to do it. It is true, indeed, that nothing obliges us to will but our ſelves; but then that which we call [Our Selves] is not our <hi>Being</hi> purely natural, or per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fectly free in reſpect of Good and Evil; but our <hi>Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing</hi> diſpos'd toward one of them by certain Modifica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, which either corrupt or perfect it, and render us in the ſight of God either Juſt or Sinners; and theſe Diſpoſitions we ſhould encreaſe or deſtroy by Acts which are the natural Cauſes of Habits.</p>
               <pb n="34" facs="tcp:97672:24"/>
               <p n="4">IV. But to do this, we muſt farther ſuppoſe that o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther important Truth, that the Soul doth not always produce the Acts of its predominant Habit. For it is evident, that if a Man whoſe ruling Diſpoſition is Ava<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rice, ſhould never act but by ſome Motion of Avarice; he would be ſo far from ever becoming Liberal, that his Vice would continually augment; according to that Principle which we have before laid down, that Acts produce and fortifie Habits. Nay, we muſt allow that it is in the power of a vitious Man to perform ſome Acts of Vertue, in order to free himſelf from his vitious Habits, and to become a good Man; but this Propoſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion requires a little further Explication.</p>
               <p n="5">V. I ſay then in reſpect of particular Habits, Firſt, That a covetous Man, for Example, may act by a mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive of Ambition; this is neither difficult to believe nor prove. Secondly, That a covetous Man may do an Action contrary to Avarice, by which he is govern'd; for a covetous Man may be alſo Ambitious. This being ſuppos'd, I ſay that if his Paſſion for Riches be not mov'd, and his Ambition be; or if his Avarice be leſs excited than his Ambition, in a reciprocal Proportion of the force of theſe two Paſſions, it is certain that the cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tous Man will do an act of Liberality, if at that in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtant he determines himſelf to act, which is certainly in his own power to do. For a Man can will nothing but Good; and at that inſtant the covetous Man will think it better to do that act of Liberality than not do it; he will Sacrifice his love of Mony to that of Glory. Thus it is evident, that the Sinner may for Reaſons of Self-love, avoid following any certain determinate Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of his Paſſions, if he can but excite ſome contrary Paſſions, and till then ſuſpend the conſent of his Will. But ſtill this is not ſufficient to prove that he who Sins may help Sinning; that the Sinner may rid himſelf of his vitious Habits, and the juſt Man loſe his Charity.</p>
               <p n="6">VI. Indeed the Caſe of particular Habits, as Ava<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rice or Liberality, is not the ſame with that of the Love of Order, or Self-love; and tho' perhaps it may be granted, that a covetous Man may do an act of Libe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rality; yet without doubt it will not be ſo readily a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greed, that a Heathen can do an action conformable to Order, or for Love of Order. For my part, I ſhall
<pb n="35" facs="tcp:97672:24"/>not diſpute it; but only endeavour to explain my own Sentiments clearly. Let every one follow that which the Evidence of Reaſon and the Authority of Faith ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lige him to believe; and leave me, when I go out of the Way, which ſhould lead me in the Search of Truth.</p>
               <p n="7">VII. If Sinners or Heathens had no Love at all for Order, they would be altogether incorrigible; and if the Righteous had no Self-love, they could not poſſibly Sin; for according to my firſt Principle, Habits are form'd and preſerv'd by Acts. The Sinner being ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pos'd to have no Love but for himſelf, cannot act but by Self-love, and therefore all his Actions muſt encreaſe the Corruption of his Heart. On the other ſide, if the righteous Man be ſuppos'd to have no Love but for Order, he cannot act but by the Love of Order; and then all his Actions muſt ſtill encreaſe his Vertue: So that upon this Suppoſition, that a Sinner or a Heathen hath no Love but Self-love, and a juſt Man no Love but the Love of Order, the Sinner muſt be incorrigible, and the juſt Man impeccable. But I think I have ſufficient<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly prov'd in the foregoing Chapter, that the greateſt Sinners have always ſome diſpoſition to love Order; and I think it cannot be doubted, but that the beſt Men always retain ſome Relicks of Self-love.</p>
               <p n="8">VIII. It is true indeed, that a Heathen can never acquire Charity, nor do any Action that may merit thoſe Aſſiſtances that are neceſſary for obtaining the ruling Love of the immutable Order; but he may do A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctions conformable to Order, he may perform good and meritorious Actions:
<note place="margin">Chap. I.</note> For a Heathen has always ſome Idea of Order; this Idea is indeleble: He hath al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ways ſome Love for Order;
<note place="margin">Chap. III.</note> this Love is natural and immortal. Now all Love is active, when once it is ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cited. And therefore if his Self-love do not oppoſe the Action of his Love of Order, his Love of Order will act and produce its proper Acts: Nay, tho' his Self<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>love ſhould oppoſe his Love of Order, yet if his Love of Order be more excited than his Self-love, in a reci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>procal Proportion of the greatneſs of theſe two habitual Loves and their actual Motion, his Love for Order would ſurmount his Self-love, if at that inſtant he de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>termin'd himſelf to act.</p>
               <pb n="36" facs="tcp:97672:25"/>
               <p n="9">IX. For inſtance, an innocent Man is led to Execu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion. This is contrary to Order. A Heathen knows it, and can by a word ſpeaking, prevent the breach of Order. I ſuppoſe that his Self-love is not at all con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cern'd in the Life or Death of the Man. Certainly he will prevent, or at leaſt will have Strength and Reaſon enough to ſpeak and prevent this Offence againſt Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der. For my part, I do not doubt, upon the Suppo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſition which I have made, but that he would prevent it. For all Men naturally love Order and are ſo united to it, that one cannot violate Order, without offending them in ſome meaſure. The ſame things being ſuppos'd, tho' this Man we ſpeak of were covetous, yet if his Paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion for Mony were laid a ſleep for a little while, or, tho' it were excited, yet if only a Penny were deſir'd of him to ſave the Life of that innocent Man, certainly he would, or at leaſt might do an action contrary to his Self-love; for in truth, that oppoſition is but inconſide<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable; but it would be a very great Offence againſt Order, which he is naturally diſpos'd to Love, if he ſhould not offer that ſmall Sacrifice to it.</p>
               <p n="10">X. Now thoſe actions are good, becauſe they are conformable to Order; and they are meritorious, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe they are accompanied with a Sacrifice of Self-love to the Love of Order: But they are not meritorious in reſpect of the true Goods, nor of any thing that leads to the Poſſeſſion of them, becauſe thoſe Sacrifices they offer are but inconſiderable; and beſides, they proceed from a corrupted Heart, where Self-love hath an abſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lute Dominion.</p>
               <p n="11">XI. A Man can have no Right to the true Goods, if he be not juſt in the ſight of God; and he cannot be juſt before God, if he be not more diſpos'd to love Order than to love any Thing, and even his own ſelf; or if he be not diſpos'd not to love himſelf but accord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to Order. So that tho' we ſhould ſuppoſe a Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>then to love Order above all other Things with an actual Love, which cannot be done but by the Motion of Grace; yet God who judges the Soul not according to that which is tranſient in it, but according to its ſix'd and permanent Diſpoſitions, could not look upon him as Juſt and Holy. For one ſingle Act of loving God above all Things, cannot naturally change an in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veterate
<pb n="37" facs="tcp:97672:25"/>Habit of Self-love. This cannot be done with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
<note n="†" place="margin">I ſhall ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plain this in Chap. 8.</note> the uſe of the Sacraments, which Chriſt hath in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtituted for our Juſtification, whereby one ſingle Act of the love of God hath power to produce a Habit of it, which alone gives us a Right to the true Goods. And therefore none of the Philoſophers, not <hi>Socrates,</hi> nor <hi>Plato,</hi> nor <hi>Epictetus,</hi> how enlightned ſoever they were, in reſpect of their Duties, nor even thoſe who may be ſuppos'd to have ſhed their Blood for the Order of Ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtice, can be ſaved, if they did not receive that Grace which is to be obtain'd by Faith alone; becauſe God, the juſt Judge, could not judge them but according to the permanent Diſpoſition of their Wills; and tho' it were naturally poſſible for a Man to lay down his Neck by an actual Motion of the love of Juſtice, yet this alone would not change the natural and inveterate Habit of his Self-love, a Habit confirm'd and augment<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed every moment by the Motions of Concupiſence, dur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the whole Courſe of his Life.</p>
               <p n="12">XII. Nevertheleſs, ſince Heathens always retain ſome love for Order, they may avoid the Sin which they com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mit, by reviving that Love, by declining every thing that may excite Self-love, and by not conſenting before they are forc'd to it, as I ſhall ſhew hereafter; but in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed, they cannot fulfill the Commandments of God; they cannot love Order more than themſelves in all Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes. This Reaſon may convince us of, and Faith in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forms us that it is impoſſible for them to do; only thoſe who have Faith can do this, and even amongſt them, all have not an equal Power; there are none but the Juſt, to whom nothing is wanting; for the reſt, they may have recourſe to Prayer, if they are ſenſible of their own Weakneſs; they may by the aſſiſtance of their Faith, and in conſequence of the Promiſes of Jeſus Chriſt, not by the neceſſity of the immutable Order of Juſtice, merit the next degree of Power to keep the Command<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments of God upon all Occaſions.</p>
               <p n="13">XIII. I ſhall repeat in a few words, thoſe eſſential Truths which I have here prov'd, and which are ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſary for the right underſtanding of the ſequel of this Diſcourſe. Habits are acquir'd and confirm'd by Acts; the ruling Habit doth not always act: A Man may do ſuch Acts as have no relation to it, and ſometimes ſuch
<pb n="38" facs="tcp:97672:26"/>as are contrary to it; and therefore he may alter his Habits.</p>
               <p n="14">XIV. Again, there is no Man, let him be never ſo vitious, who hath not ſome diſpoſition to love Order: And therefore every free and rational Man may, I do not ſay become juſt, but correct and amend himſelf.</p>
               <p n="15">XV. But ſuppoſing the aſſiſtance of Grace, every Man may become juſt: For the ruling Love of the immutable Order which juſtifies us in the ſight of God, is a fix'd and permanent Diſpoſition, it is a Habit. Now we may acquire this Habit by the aſſiſtance of Grace, not only becauſe we may by the help of actual Grace free<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly perform ſo many or ſuch vigorous Acts of the love of Order above all Things, as will produce the Habit of it; but with more eaſe and certainty, becauſe we may come to the Sacraments by the motion of this Love, and the Sacraments of the New Teſtament infuſe into our Hearts juſtifying Charity.</p>
               <p n="16">XVI. All then that we have to do to acquire and pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerve the ruling Love of the immutable Order; or in ſhorter terms, the love of Order conſiſts in ſearching di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligently what are the things that excite this Love and make it produce its proper Acts, and what thoſe are that can ſtop the actual Motion of Self-love. Now I know but two Principles which determine the na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tural Motion of the Will, and ſtir up the Habits, to wit, Light and Senſe. Without one of theſe Princi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples, no Habit is form'd naturally, and thoſe which are form'd remain unactive. If any one will take the pains to conſult what he finds within himſelf, he will eaſily be ſatisfied, that the Will never actually loves any good, except the Light diſcovers it, or Pleaſure renders it preſent to the Soul: And if we conſult Reaſon, we ſhall be convinc'd that it muſt be ſo; for otherwiſe, the Author of Nature would imprint uſeleſs Motions on the Will.</p>
               <p n="17">XVII. There is nothing then but Light and Pleaſure which produce any actual Motion in the Soul. Light diſcovers to it the Good which it loves by an irreſiſtible impreſſion; and Pleaſure aſſures it, that that Good is actually preſent; for the Soul is never more fully con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vinced of its Good, than when it finds it ſelf actually touch'd with the Pleaſure which makes it happy. Let us
<pb n="39" facs="tcp:97672:26"/>therefore enquire into the Means by which we may cauſe the Light to diffuſe it ſelf in our Minds, and make our Hearts be touch'd with ſuch Senſations as are ſuitable to our Deſign, which is to produce in us the Acts of the Love of Order, or to hinder us from form<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing thoſe of Self-love; for it is evident, that all the Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cepts of Morality abſolutely depend on theſe Means. In this enquiry, I ſhall obſerve the following Method.</p>
               <p n="18">XVIII. Firſt, I ſhall examine by what Means we may be enlightned as to our Duties: For the Light ought always to go firſt; and beſides, the diſcovery of Good depends much more upon our ſelves than the reliſh of it. For generally our Wills are the occaſional, di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rect and immediate Cauſes of our Knowledge, but ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver of our Senſe. Afterwards I ſhall enquire into the occaſional Cauſes of our Senſations, and the power we have over them, that by their means we may diſpoſe the Author of Grace and Nature to affect us in ſuch a man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner, that the Love of Order may be excited in us and quicken us, and Self-love or Concupiſcence may remain without Motion.</p>
               <p n="19">XIX. I ſhall firſt ſpeak of thoſe Senſations which God produces in us in conſequence of the Order of Grace, becauſe theſe have power to produce in us ſuch Acts of the Love of Order as are capable of forming the Habit of it. After that, I ſhall treat of thoſe Senſations pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duc'd in us by God, in conſequence of the Order of Nature; which cannot weaken our vitious Habits, but indirectly, and which we are almoſt always concern'd to avoid, that we may preſerve in our Soul the Power and Liberty of loving the true Good, and living ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to Order. For the different ways by which we avoid theſe Senſations, make one of the principal parts of Morality; and moſt of the Names of Vertue were invented only to expreſs the acquir'd Diſpoſitions of avoiding them.</p>

               <head>CHAP. V. <hi>Of the Strength of the Mind. Our Deſires are the occa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſional Cauſes of our Knowledge. The Contemplation of abſtract Ideas is difficult. The Strength of the Mind conſiſts in an acquir'd Habit of enduring the Labour of Attention. The way to acquire it is to Silence our Sen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes, Imagination and Paſſions, to Regulate our Studies, and to Meditate only on clear Ideas.</hi>
               </head>
               <p n="1">I. WE are aſſur'd both by Faith and Reaſon, That God alone is the true Cauſe of all Things: But Experience teaches us, That he never acts but ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to certain Laws which he hath preſcrib'd to him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf, and which he conſtantly obſerves: For inſtance, it is God alone that moves all Bodies, which perhaps would require a great many Words to convince ſome People of. But this being ſuppos'd, as having been prov'd elſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>where, it is evident from Experience, that God never moves Bodies but when they ſtrike againſt one another. So that this <hi>Impulſe</hi> of Bodies may be ſaid to be the <hi>Oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caſional</hi> Cauſe which infallibly determines the Efficacy of that general Law, by which God produces a vaſt Variety of Motions in his Workmanſhip.</p>
               <p n="2">II. Again, it is God alone that diffuſes Light in all ſpiritual Subſtances; this is a Truth which I have ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficiently explain'd already: But for the <hi>Occaſional</hi> Cauſe which determines him to communicate it to us, we muſt ſearch no where but in our ſelves. God by a ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neral Law which he conſtantly obſerves, and of which he hath foreſeen all the conſequences, hath annex'd the preſence of Ideas to the Attention of our Mind; ſo that when we can command our Attention, and make uſe of it, the Light never fails to diffuſe it ſelf in us propor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tionably to our Labour. This is ſo true, that ungrate<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful and ſtupid Man makes it a ground of his Vanity; he imagins himſelf to be the Cauſe of his Knowledge, becauſe God always anſwers his Deſires ſo faithfully and conſtantly. For having an inward Senſe of his own Attention, and no Knowledge of the operation of
<pb n="41" facs="tcp:97672:27"/>God, he looks upon the endeavour of his deſires,
<note place="margin">Page 9.</note> which ſhould convince him of his Impotence, as the true cauſe of thoſe Ideas which accompany that endea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour.</p>
               <p n="3">III. Now God muſt have plac'd the <hi>occaſional</hi> cauſes of our Knowledge in our ſelves for ſeveral Reaſons, the chief of which is, that otherwiſe we ſhould not have been Maſters of our Wills. For ſince our Wills muſt be enlightned before they can be mov'd; if it were not in our power to Think, it would not be in our power to Will. We ſhould not be perfectly free, nor conſequent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly in a condition to merit the true Goods, for which we are Created.</p>
               <p n="4">IV. The attention of the Mind then is a kind of na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tural Prayer, by which we obtain the illumination of Reaſon. But ſince Sin enter'd into the World, the Mind often finds it ſelf in the midſt of barren and diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mal Solitudes; it cannot Pray; the labour of Attention wearies and diſheartens it. Indeed the Labour is at firſt very great, and the recompenſe but ſmall; and beſides we find our ſelves continually ſollicited, preſs'd and agitated by the Imagination and Paſſions, whoſe inſpiration and motions we follow with Pleaſure. How<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever there is a neceſſity for it, we muſt call upon Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon if we will be enlightned by it: There is no other way to obtain Light and Underſtanding, but by the labour of Attention. Faith is a Gift of God, which we cannot merit; but Underſtanding is generally given on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly to merit. Faith is purely Grace in all Senſes: But the underſtanding of Truth is Grace only in ſuch a Senſe, that we muſt merit it by our own Labour, or by co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>operating with Grace.</p>
               <p n="5">V. Now thoſe who are fitted to undergo this Labour, and are always attentive to the Truth that ſhould guide them, have ſuch a diſpoſition as without doubt deſerves a more magnificent Name than any of thoſe that are given to the moſt ſplendid Vertues. But tho' this Ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bit or Vertue be inſeparably joyn'd to the love of Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der, it is ſo little known among us, that I know not whether we have given it the honour of a particular Name. I ſhall therefore take the liberty to call it by an equivocal Name, <hi>Strength of Mind.</hi>
               </p>
               <pb n="42" facs="tcp:97672:28"/>
               <p n="6">VI. For the obtaining this true Strength whereby the Mind is enabled to bear the Labour of Attention, we muſt begin to Labour betimes; for naturally we can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not acquire any Habits but by Acts, we cannot gain Strength but by Exerciſe: But perhaps the great diffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culty lies in beginning. We remember that we have begun, and have been forc'd to leave off. This diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>heartens us, we think our ſelves incapable of Medita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, and renounce Reaſon. If this be the caſe, what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever we can ſay to excuſe our Sloth and Negligence, we muſt alſo renounce Vertue, at leaſt in part. For without the Labour of Attention, we can never com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehend the greatneſs of Religion, the ſanctity of Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rality, the littleneſs of every thing but God, the ridi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culouſneſs of our Paſſions, and all our inward Miſeries. Without this Labour, the Soul will be in continual Darkneſs and Diſorder; for there is naturally no other way to obtain the Light which ſhould guide us; we ſhall be eternally diſquieted and ſtrangly perplex'd; for we are afraid of every thing when we walk in the Dark, and think our ſelves environ'd with Precipices. Faith indeed doth guide and ſupport us; but that is be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe it always produces ſome Light by the Attention which it ſtirs up in us: For there is nothing but Light that can give us Courage and Aſſurance, when we have ſo many Enemies to fear.</p>
               <p n="7">VII. What muſt we do then to ſet about our Work without being diſcourag'd? Let us ſee what it is that puts us out of Heart. We meditate with Pain, and without recompenſe. The Pain on one ſide diſheartens us, and on the other the Reward does not ſufficiently encourage us. We muſt then make the Pain leſs, and the Reward greater. This is plain. But there is no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing more difficult: Nay, it is impoſſible for the great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt part of Mankind. And for this Reaſon it is, that we need a more compendious way to be aſſur'd of the Truth, and that the viſible Authority of the Church is neceſſary for our Conduct. For even thoſe of the great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt Genius, if they deviate from Faith, or abandon the Analogy of Faith, wander out of the way which leads to Underſtanding; they break the Chain of Truths, which are all link'd together in ſuch a manner, that one ſingle Falſhood being granted for truth, a Man may overthrow
<pb n="43" facs="tcp:97672:28"/>all the Sciences, if he knows how to argue by a de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duction of Conſequences.</p>
               <p n="8">VIII. To leſſen the Pain which we find in Medita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, we muſt avoid every thing that takes up any room in the Mind unprofitably: And as there is no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing that poſſeſſes it more than that which touches, ſtrikes and agitates it; it is evident that we muſt care<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully avoid all Objects that pleaſe our Senſes and excite our Paſſions. The Senſes and Paſſions being certain Modifications of the proper ſubſtance of the Soul, all intellectual Ideas which do not modify it, muſt of ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſity diſappear in the preſence of ſenſible Objects, tho' we ſtrive never ſo much to retain them, and to diſcover their Relations. Beſides, we are perſwaded that it is in our own power to recal theſe intellectual Ideas; but Experience aſſures us that our Wills are not the occaſional cauſes of our Senſes. And therefore we readily lay hold of thoſe Senſations, by which we en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joy thoſe Delights that paſs away, and cannot be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>call'd; and neglect the pure Ideas whereby we diſcover the Truth which remains fix'd, and which we can con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>template whenever we pleaſe. For we muſt reſolve ſpeedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly as to thoſe Goods which fly away from us, but we may defer the examination of thoſe that are ſtable and always preſent. In ſhort we would always be actu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally happy: We would never be actually Miſerable. Actual Pleaſure makes us actually Happy, and actual Pain actually Miſerable. Therefore every Senſation which participates of Pleaſure or Pain, poſſeſſes the Mind: Every motion of the Soul, which hath actual good or evil for its Object, governs the Will. So that we muſt uſe very ſtrong endeavours to contemplate Truth, when our Senſes are affected, and our Paſſions ſtir'd: And ſince we find by Experience, that theſe en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deavours are at that time very inſignificant, it is im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſſible but that the Soul being ſpent and tir'd muſt be diſcontented and diſcourag'd. And therefore thoſe who treat of Prayer, give us this weighty Admonition, to la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bour inceſſantly in mortifying our Senſes, and not to meddle with thoſe things which do not concern us, and which may in the ſequel by our indiſcreet engaging in them, excite in us a Thouſand troubleſom Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions.</p>
               <pb n="44" facs="tcp:97672:29"/>
               <p n="9">IX. The next thing we have to do, is to avoid as much as we can, all thoſe Sciences and Occupations which have nothing but ſhew and outward ſplendor; thoſe Sciences in which the Memory only is employ'd, thoſe Studies and Occupations in which the Imagina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion is too much exercis'd. When a Man's Head is full, he is content with his imaginary Riches, and being ſwell'd with Pride, he ſcorns the labour of Attention; or if he owns the neceſſity of it, it will coſt him too much Pains to remove all thoſe falſe Ideas which his Memory furniſhes him with. And when the Imagina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion is too much exercis'd, the evidence of Truth doth not make a lively impreſſion on us: For it is certain that there is nothing more oppoſite to Reaſon, than an Imagi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation too well furniſh'd, too nice, too active, or rather a malignant and corrupted Imagination: For the Imagination ought always to be ſilent when Reaſon Speaks; but when we have us'd our ſelves to employ it much, it continually interrupts and oppoſes it. And therefore we ſee that thoſe Men of Senſe I ſpeak of, and your great. Wits as they fancy themſelves, have not much Piety or Religion; for indeed there are no Men more blind than they. All the Light in them is extinguiſh'd by Pride; for being always highly con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceited of themſelves, and ſatiated or rather having no Appetite to Truth, they cannot bring themſelves to think of earning by the Sweat of their Brow the Bread of the Soul, a Nouriſhment of which they have no man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner of Reliſh.</p>
               <p n="10">X. A Man muſt labour with the Soul to maintain the life of the Soul; this is abſolutely neceſſary. But nothing is more ſervile than to employ the labour of the Soul in getting Mony or Honour. That a Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chanick ſhould labour with the Body to maintain the life of the Body, to get Bread, this is conformable to Order; at leaſt while his Body is at Work, he may feed his Mind, and employ it in good Thoughts: But for a Magiſtrate, a States-man, a Merchant, to laviſh away the ſtrength of his Mind in getting thoſe Goods that are many times of no uſe for the life of the Body, and always dangerous to that of the Soul, is a very great Folly. And therefore we ſhould in the third Place avoid all ſuch Employments as deprive us of the liberty of the
<pb n="45" facs="tcp:97672:29"/>Mind, except God engages us in them by an extraor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinary Vocation. For if Charity, or the Laws of the Community in which we live, oblige us to them, and we take upon us no more than we are able to bear; God will make up in us an equivalent to that which we might have obtain'd by the labour of Meditation. And even then we ſhall find time enough to examine our ſelves in relation to our Duties, if we are not go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vern'd by Ambition or Intereſt in the exerciſe of our Calling.</p>
               <p n="11">XI. Every Man knows well enough what things are apt to agitate and diſtract his Mind; at leaſt he may be inform'd by conſulting Experience, or that inward Senſe which he hath of himſelf. And therefore I ſhall not dwell any longer in ſetting down particularly what we muſt do to make Meditation eaſy to us. It is only the Body which makes the Soul dull and heavy: This is the ground of our Stupidity. Now all ſenſible Ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects work upon us only by means of the Body. There<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore it is evident that to hearken without Pain to the Anſwers which Truth pronounces within us, we have nothing to do but to ſilence our Senſes, Imagination and Paſſions; or in a Word, to ſtill that confus'd Noiſe which the Body makes in us. Now every Man knows by his own Experience, that the Body is quiet enough, when nothing ſtirs it from without, or hath not too much ſtir'd it before. For ſince it retains a long time thoſe impreſſions and motions which it hath receiv'd from ſenſible Objects, I confeſs that the Imagination re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mains polluted and hurt, when we have been ſo indiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creet as to be too familiar with Pleaſure. Notwith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding the Wound will cloſe up of it ſelf, and the Brain will return to its former ſtate, if we carefully avoid the action of all Objects that ſtrike our Senſes; which we are always able to do, at leaſt in ſome mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure, with thoſe neceſſary Helps, which I all along ſuppoſe. Let us do what we can on our part, and we ſhall be ſo far from being out of love with Meditation, that we ſhall find our ſelves ſo well rewarded, that we ſhall not repent of our Pains; provided nevertheleſs that we obſerve the following Rule, without which, not<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>withſtanding all our Meditation, we ſhall never be rewarded with a clear view of Truth. My Deſign here
<pb n="46" facs="tcp:97672:30"/>is not to teach the Art of Thinking, nor to deliver all the Rules by which the Mind ought to regulate every ſtep in takes in the ſearch of Truth. The Subject of this Diſcourſe is Morality; a Science neceſſary for all Mankind; and not Logick, which only they who would be capable of diſcovering Truth in all manner of Subjects are oblig'd to ſtudy throughly.</p>
               <p n="12">XII. The only Rule which I would have carefully obſerv'd, is to meditate only on clear Ideas and unde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niable Experiments. To meditate on confus'd Senſations and doubtful Experiments, is loſt labour; this is to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>template nothing but Chimeras, and to follow Error. The immutable and neceſſary Order, the divine Law is alſo our Law: This ought to be the principal Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject of our Meditations. Now there is nothing more abſtracted and leſs Subject to Senſe than this Order. I grant that we may alſo be guided by Order made ſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſible and viſible by the actions and precepts of Jeſus Chriſt: Yet that is becauſe that ſenſible Order raiſes the Mind to the knowledge of the intellectual Order; for the Word made Fleſh is our Model, only to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>form us to Reaſon, the indiſpenſable Model of all intel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligent Beings, the Model by which the firſt Man was form'd, and according to which we are to be reform'd by the fooliſhneſs of Faith, which leads us by our Senſes to our Reaſon, and to the contemplation of our intel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lectual Model.</p>
               <p n="13">XIII. A Man that is thrown down on the Ground, ſupports himſelf with the Ground, but 'tis in order to riſe again. Jeſus Chriſt accommodates himſelf to our Weakneſs, but 'tis to draw us out of it. Faith ſpeaks to the Soul only by the Body, it is true; but it is to the end that a Man ſhould not hearken to the Body, that he ſhould retire into himſelf, that he ſhould contemplate the true Ideas of things, and ſilence his Senſes, Ima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gination and Paſſions: That he ſhould begin upon Earth to make the ſame uſe of his Mind that he ſhall do in Heaven, where Underſtanding ſhall ſucceed Faith, where the Body ſhall be ſubject to the Soul, and Reaſon ſhall have the ſole Government. For the Body of it ſelf ſpeaks to the Soul only for it ſelf; this is an eſſential Truth, of which we cannot be too fully convinc'd.</p>
               <pb n="47" facs="tcp:97672:30"/>
               <p n="14">XIV. Truth and Order conſiſt in nothing elſe but in the relations of Greatneſs and Perfection which Things have to one another. But how ſhall we diſcover theſe Relations evidently, when we want clear Ideas? How ſhall we give to every thing the Rank which belongs to it, if we meaſure nothing but with relation to our ſelves? Certainly, if we look upon our ſelves as the Center of the Univerſe, a Notion which the Body is con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinually putting into us; all Order is deſtroy'd, all Truths change their nature; a Torch becomes bigger than a Star; a Fruit more valuable than the ſafety of our Country: The Earth, which Aſtronomers conſider but as a Point in reſpect of the Univerſe, is the Uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſe it ſelf. And this Univerſe is yet but a Point in reſpect of our particular Being. At ſome certain times when the Body ſpeaks to us, and the Paſſions are ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cited, we are ready, if it were poſſible, to ſacrifice it to our Glory and Pleaſures.</p>
               <p n="15">XV. By clear Ideas, which I make the principal Object of thoſe who would know and love Order, I mean not only thoſe between which the Mind can diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cover the preciſe and exact Relations, ſuch as are all thoſe which are the Object of Mathematical Knowledge, and may be expreſs'd by Numbers, or repreſented by Lines: But I underſtand in general by clear Ideas, all ſuch as produce any Light in the Mind of thoſe who contemplate them, and from which one may draw cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain Conſequences. So that I reckon amongſt clear Ideas not only ſimple Ideas, but alſo thoſe Truths which con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain the Relations that are between Ideas. I compre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hend alſo in this Number common Notions and Principles of Morality, and in a word all clear Truths which are evident either of themſelves, or by Demonſtration, or by an infallible Authority; tho' to ſpeak nicely, theſe laſt are rather certain than clear and evident.</p>
               <p n="16">XVI. By undeniable Experiments, I mean chiefly thoſe matters of Fact which Faith informs us of, and thoſe of which we are convinc'd by the inward Senſe we have of what paſſes within our ſelves. If we will be govern'd by Examples, and judge of Things by Opinion, we ſhall be deceiv'd every Moment; for there is nothing more equivocal and more confus'd than the Actions of Men, and many times nothing more falſe than
<pb n="48" facs="tcp:97672:31"/>that which paſſes for certain with whole Nations. Fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, it is a very fruitleſs thing to meditate upon that which paſſes within our ſelves, if we do it with a Deſign of diſcovering the nature of it. For we have no clear Ideas of our own Being, nor of any of its Modifications; and we can never diſcover the nature of any Beings, but by contemplating the clear Ideas by which they are repreſented to us. But we cannot meditate too much upon our inward Senſations and Motions, to diſcover their Connexions and Relations, and the natural or oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caſional cauſes which excite them; for this is a thing of infinite conſequence in relation to Morality.</p>
               <p n="17">XVII. The knowledge of Man is of all the Sciences the moſt neceſſary for our purpoſe: But it is only an experimental Science, reſulting from the reflection we make on that which paſſes within us. This Reflection doth not diſcover to us the nature of thoſe two Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtances of which we are compos'd, but it teaches us the Laws of the union of the Soul and Body, and is ſerviceable to us in eſtabliſhing thoſe great Principles of Morality, by which we ought to govern our Acti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons.</p>
               <p n="18">XVIII. On the contrary the knowledge of God is not at all Experimental: We diſcover the Divine Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture and Attributes, when we can contemplate with Attention the vaſt and immenſe Idea of an infinitely per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect Being; for we muſt not judge of God but accord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to the clear Idea we have of him. This is a thing not ſufficiently taken notice of: For moſt Men judge of God with a relation to themſelves: they make him like themſelves a great many ways; they conſult them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves, inſtead of conſulting only the Idea of an infinite<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly perfect Being. Thus they take away from him thoſe divine Attributes which they cannot eaſily conceive, and attribute to him a Wiſdom, a Power, a Conduct, in a word Sentiments reſembling, at leaſt in ſome mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure thoſe which are moſt familiar to them. And yet the knowledge of our Duties ſuppoſes that of the Divine Attributes; and our Conduct can never be ſure and well grounded if it be not built upon and govern'd by that which God obſerves in the execution of his De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſigns.</p>
               <pb n="49" facs="tcp:97672:31"/>
               <p n="19">XIX. The Knowledge of Order, which is our in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diſpenſable Law, is compounded of both theſe, clear Ideas and inward Senſations. Every Man knows that it is better to be Good, than Rich, a Prince, or a Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>queror; but every Man doth not ſee it by a clear Idea. Children and ignorant People know well enough when they do ill; but 'tis becauſe the ſecret Check of Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon reproves them for it, and not always becauſe the Light diſcovers it to them. For Order conſider'd ſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culatively and preciſely, only as it contains the Rela<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions of Perfection, enlightens the Mind without mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving it; if it be taken only for the Law of God, the Law of all Spiritual Beings, and conſider'd only ſo far as it hath the force of a Law, (for God loves Order himſelf, and irreſiſtibly wills that we ſhould love it, or that we ſhould love every Thing in proportion to its being amiable); Order, I ſay, as it is the natural and neceſſary Principle and Rule of all the Motions of the Soul, touches, penetrates, and convinces the Mind without enlightning it. So that we may diſcover Order by a clear Idea, but we know it alſo by Senſation; for ſince God loves Order, and continually imprints on us a Love and Motion like his own, we muſt neceſſarily be inform'd by the ſure and compendious way of Senſation, when we follow or for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſake the immutable Order.</p>
               <p n="20">XX. But we muſt obſerve, that this way of diſcover<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Order by Senſation or Inſtinct, is often render'd uncertain by Sin, which hath introduc'd Concupiſcence; becauſe the ſecret influences of the Paſſions are of the ſame nature with that inward Senſation. For when we act contrary to Opinion and Cuſtom, we often feel ſuch inward Checks as very much reſemble thoſe of Reaſon and Order. Before Sin enter'd into the World, the Senſe of inward Reproof was a ſign that could not be miſtaken; for then that alone ſpoke with Authority; but ſince that time, the ſecret inſpirations of our Paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions are not ſubject to our Wills: So that they are eaſily confounded with the inſpirations of inward Truth, when the Mind is not enlightned. Hence it is that there are ſo many People who ſeriouſly and in good earneſt maintain abominable Errors. A falſe Idea of Religion and Morality, which agrees with their In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tereſts and Paſſions, appears Truth it ſelf to them; and
<pb n="50" facs="tcp:97672:32"/>being convinc'd by a pleaſing Senſe within them, which juſtifies their exceſs, they drive on their raſh and indiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creet Zeal with all the Motion of Self-love.</p>
               <p n="21">XXI. There is nothing then more certain and ſecure, than Light; we cannot ſix our Attention too long on clear Ideas; and tho' we may ſuffer our ſelves to be ani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mated by the inward Senſe, yet we muſt never be guid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed by it. We muſt contemplate Order in it ſelf, and permit this Senſation only to keep up our Attention by the Motion which it excites in us; otherwiſe our Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ditations will never be rewarded with a clear proſpect of Truth; we ſhall be diſguſted every moment, and being always inconſtant, doubtful and perplex'd, we ſhall ſuffer our ſelves to be blindly led by our Fancy.</p>
               <p n="22">XXII. Indeed, when our Heart is corrupted, we are not in a Condition to contemplate Order as it is in it ſelf; we conſider with Pleaſure, only thoſe imaginary Relations which things have to our ſelves, and neglect thoſe real Relations which they have to one another. We may then love the Mathematicks; but it is becauſe they bring us Reputation or Profit, and becauſe they examine only the Relations of Greatneſs; whereas Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der Conſiſts in the Relations of Perfection. The Evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence of Truth is always agreeable, when it doth not claſh with our Self-love; but naturally we do not love a Light which diſcovers our hidden Diſorders; a Light which condemns, puniſhes, and covers us with Shame and Confuſion. Order, the Divine Law, is a terrible, threatning and inexorable Law: No Man can think up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on it without fear and horror, when he will not obey it; all this is true. But yet, tho' the Heart be corrupted, Self-love enlightned may ſometimes ſtop or diminiſh the Motion of the Paſſions. We do not love Diſorder for Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>order's ſake; and a Man may deſire his Converſion, when he hopes to heighten his Pleaſures by it. After all, I ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe the neceſſary helps; for I confeſs, that without the aſſiſtance of Grace, we cannot labour in our Converſion as we ought, nor ſo much as have one good Thought which may contribute to the Cure of our Diſtempers.</p>

               <head>CHAP. VI. <hi>Of the Liberty of the Mind. We ſhould ſuſpend our Aſſent as much as we can, which is the great Rule. By the Liberty of the Mind we may avoid Error and Sin, as by the Strength of the Mind we free our ſelves from Ig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>norance. The Liberty of the Mind, as well as the Strength of it, is a Habit which is confirm'd by uſe. Some inſtances of its <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>ſefulneſs in Phyſicks, Morality, and Civil Life.</hi>
               </head>
               <p n="1">I. WE cannot diſcover Truth without the Labour of Attention, becauſe this Labour alone is re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>warded with Light. Before a Man can ſupport and continue the Labour of Attention, he muſt have gain'd ſome Strength of Mind, and ſome Authority over the Body to impoſe Silence on his Senſes, Imagination and Paſſions, as I have ſhew'd in the foregoing Chapter. But how great Strength of Mind ſoever he hath acquir'd, he cannot Labour inceſſantly; and if he could, yet there are ſome Subjects ſo obſcure, that the Mind of Man cannot penetrate into them. Therefore to keep him from falling into Error, it is not ſufficient to have a ſtrong Mind to endure Labour, but he muſt alſo have another Vertue, which I cannot better expreſs than by the Equivocal Name of <hi>Liberty of Mind;</hi> by which a Man witholds his Aſſent till he be irreſiſtibly forc'd to give it.</p>
               <p n="2">II. When we examine any very compounded Que<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtion, and our Mind finds it ſelf ſurrounded on all ſides with very great Difficulties, Reaſon permits us to give over our Labour, but it indiſpenſably requires us to ſuſpend our aſſent, and to judge of nothing, when no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing is evident. <hi>To make uſe of our Liberty as much as we can,</hi> is an eſſential and indiſpenſable Precept both of Logick and Morality: For we ought never to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve, till Evidence obliges us to it; we ought never to love that which we may without Remorſe hinder our ſelves from loving. I ſpeak of Man only as he is Ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tional, or as he governs himſelf only by Reaſon: For
<pb n="52" facs="tcp:97672:33"/>the Faithful, as ſuch, have other Principles than Light and Evidence. The Stateſman, the Burgher, the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligious, the Souldier, have each of them Principles of their own; and it is reaſonable that they ſhould follow them, tho' they do not clearly and evidently ſee that they are conformable to Reaſon. But when Faith gives no determination, we ſhould believe nothing but what we ſee. Where Cuſtom preſcribes no Rules, we ſhould follow only Faith and Reaſon; and tho' human Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority doth determine, and Cuſtom authorizes any thing, yet if we know clearly and evidently that their Determinations are falſe and erroneous, we had better renounce every thing than Reaſon: I ſay Reaſon, and not our Senſes, our Imagination, or the ſecret inſpira<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions of our Paſſions, which I deſire may be taken no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tice of. I ſpeak alſo of Authority ſubject to Error, and not of the infallible Authority of the Church; which can never be contrary to Reaſon. For Jeſus Chriſt can never contradict himſelf; Truth incarnate can never be contrary to Truth intellectual, nor the Head which go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verns the Church to univerſal Reaſon, which enlightens all Spiritual Beings.</p>
               <p n="3">III. The Strength of the Mind is to the ſearch of Truth, what the Liberty of the Mind is to the Poſſeſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion of the ſame Truth, or at leaſt to Infallibility or exemption from Error: For by the uſe we make of the Strength of our Mind we diſcover Truth, and by uſing the Liberty of our Mind we avoid Error. The Strength and Capacity of the Mind being deficient, Liberty was neceſſary for it, that by ſuſpending its Aſſent it might avoid Error, and that the Author of its Being might not alſo be the Author of its Diſorders. For the Liberty of the Mind makes amends for its Weakneſs and Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitation; and he that hath ſo much Liberty as to be always able to ſuſpend his Aſſent, tho' he cannot deli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver himſelf from Ignorance, (a neceſſary Imperfection of all finite Spirits,) may yet avoid Error and Sin, which render a Man contemptible, and make him liable to Pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſhment.</p>
               <p n="4">IV. It is certain, that if we always made uſe of our Liberty, as far as we are able, we ſhould never aſſent but to Evidence, which alone doth never deceive, as I have prov'd elſewhere, and which alſo obliges the
<pb n="53" facs="tcp:97672:33"/>Will to give its Aſſent. For when the Mind ſees clear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, it cannot doubt that it ſees; when it hath examin'd every thing that there is to examine, in order to the diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>covery of thoſe Relations or Truths which it ſearches after, it is neceſſary that it ſhould reſt there, and give over its Enquiries. In the ſame manner, as to Sin, he that loves nothing but what he evidently knows to be the true Good, nothing but what he cannot help loving, is not irregular in his Love. He loves nothing but God; for there is nothing elſe which we cannot with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out Remorſe hinder our ſelves from loving. There is nothing but God which we clearly and evidently know to be really Good, to be the true Cauſe of Happineſs, a Being infinitely Perfect, an Object capable of con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tenting the Soul, which being made for the enjoyment of all Good, may ſuſpend its Aſſent of loving that which doth not contain every thing that is Good.</p>
               <p n="5">V. Strength and Liberty of Mind then are two Ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tues, which we may call General, or to uſe the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon Term, Cardinal Vertues. For ſince we ought never to Love any thing, not do any Action, without good Conſideration, we muſt make uſe of the Strength and Liberty of our Mind every moment: Theſe Vertues, according to my Notion of them, are not natural Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culties common to all Men: There is nothing more rare, nor is there any Man who poſſeſſes them perfectly. I know well enough that Man is naturally capable of ſome Labour of Mind, but that doth not make him have a ſtrong Mind: He can alſo ſuſpend his Aſſent; but his Mind is not therefore naturally free, in ſuch a manner as I mean. The Strength and Liberty of Mind, of which I ſpeak, are Vertues which are gotten by uſe: But becauſe theſe Vertues add Perfection to the Soul, and reſtore it in ſome meaſure to its original State, (for before Sin, the Mind was every way ſtrong and free); Men do not generally look upon them as Vertues: For they imagine that Vertue inſtead of correcting and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pairing Nature, ought to change or deſtroy it. Nay, there are ſome People who think that Strength and Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berty of Mind are Faculties of the Soul, ſubſiſting in a kind of individual; and judging of others by them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves, they imagine that it is impoſſible to be attentive to thoſe Subjects which frighten and diſcourage them,
<pb n="54" facs="tcp:97672:34"/>and that it is Obſtinacy not to Aſſent to Probabilities by which they are deceiv'd.</p>
               <p n="6">VI. But the Strength and Liberty of the Mind are unequal in all Men. There are no two Perſons equal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly fit to retire into themſelves, nor equally capable of ſuſpending their Aſſent: Nay, the ſame Perſon doth not long preſerve the Strength and Liberty of his Mind in the ſame Condition: If they do not encreaſe by Uſe and Exerciſe, they muſt neceſſarily decreaſe; for there are no Vertues more oppos'd by, and more contrary to the continual Motions of Concupiſcence. Moſt Vertues agree well enough with Self-love, for we may often perform a great many Duties with Pleaſure, and by a motive of Self-love. But we cannot meditate long with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out Pain, and much leſs ſuſpend our Aſſent, or the Judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment which determines the Motions of the Soul and Bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy. When any Good diſcovers it ſelf to the Soul, and attracts it by its Charms, it is not at eaſe, if it remains unmov'd; for there is no harder Labour than to keep our ſelves firm and ſteady in a Current; when-ever we ceaſe to act, we are carried away with the Stream.</p>
               <p n="7">VII. Thus we ſee there is ſcarce any Man that ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plies himſelf to Meditation; and that thoſe who under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>take the ſearch of Truth, often want Strength and Cou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rage to bring them to the place of its Habitation; tir'd and diſhearten'd, they ſtrive to content themſelves with what they already poſſeſs, or perhaps comfort themſelves with a ridiculous contempt of what they cannot attain to, or a cowardly and mean ſpirited Deſpair. If they are deceiv'd, they turn Deceivers; if they are tir'd themſelves, they infect others with Sloth and Idleneſs; and but to ſee them, is enough to make one like them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves, diſcourag'd with Labour, and out of reliſh with Truth. For ſuch is the Nature of Men, that they had much rather deceive one another, than conſult their com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon Maſter; they are ſo credulous in reſpect of their Friends, and ſo unbelieving or ſo little attentive to the Anſwers of the Truth within them, that Opinion and Party are the general Rule of their Thoughts and A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctions.</p>
               <p n="8">VIII. In order to gain ſome Liberty of Mind, and to accuſtom our ſelves to ſuſpend our Aſſent, we muſt con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinually reflect on the prejudices or pre-occupations of
<pb n="55" facs="tcp:97672:34"/>our Minds, and the cauſe of them. We fancy we com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehend things very well, when we ceaſe to admire them; and their familiarity ridding us of all apprehen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion, our Mind readily gives its aſſent, becauſe it hath no intereſt to with-hold it. It ſignifies nothing to ſuſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pend our Aſſent, if we have no deſign to examine; for what matter is it if we do fall into Error? But it is great and agreeable to judge of every Thing. Now we can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not examine without Pain; at leaſt we muſt ſpend ſome time in Examination, which the Soul created to be happy, thinks loſt, when it is not kept in motion by Pleaſure, Vanity or Intereſt. Hence it is, that the or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinary Language is nothing but perpetual Jargon. For every Man thinks he underſtands very well what he ſays himſelf, or hears another ſay, when he hath ſaid it, or heard it ſaid a great many times over: They are only new Terms which cauſe uneaſineſs, and awa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken the Attention; and theſe new Terms, tho' never ſo clear and free from equivocal Significations, are al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ways ſuſpected; becauſe every one is capable of Suſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>picion and Apprehenſion, but there are few People ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pable of Attention ſufficient to diſcover Truth, and free themſelves from Apprehenſion. I could fill whole Volumes with Examples of expreſſions which are uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſally receiv'd, and yet their Senſe is undetermin'd and confus'd. But every Man ſhould take delight to joyn clear Ideas, if he can, to his ordinary Diſcourſe; for there are few Employments more agreeable than this, or more proper to free us from our Prejudices, and to procure us ſome Liberty of Mind.</p>
               <p n="9">IX. By the ſame Principle it is that moſt Men ima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gine they know well enough the Cauſes of thoſe natu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral Effects which are common and ordinary; and when you ask the reaſon of them, they think you muſt be ſatisfied, tho' they tell you nothing but what you know already; for they believe that we ought to give over our Enquiries, when we ceaſe to wonder, and that we ſhould aſſent to every thing, if we have nothing to fear or hope. How comes an Egg to produce a Chicken? 'Tis the Heat of the Hen which Hatches it. This is clear; there is nothing more common; you muſt be ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisfied with this. What is it that cauſes a Grain of Wheat to ſhoot out and make way thro' the Earth to
<pb n="56" facs="tcp:97672:35"/>ſpread its Root there, and produce the Ear? 'Tis the Rain that does all this; What would you have more? Or if you be not contented with theſe or the like An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwers, thoſe who paſs for Philoſophers will tell you, that <hi>Heat</hi> and <hi>Moiſture,</hi> Terms clear enough in all Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcience, are the fruitful Principles of the generation and corruption of all Things. They will tell you that the little Animals are engender'd of <hi>Corruption</hi> and <hi>Putrefa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction;</hi> that the great ones preſerve their Species by cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain <hi>ſeminal</hi> or <hi>prolifick</hi> Powers, which form and rank all the parts of the <hi>Foetus:</hi> But that the Sun and Moon preſide over all, or it may be a <hi>Primum Mobile,</hi> which gives motion to all the Bodies which it contains. Theſe fine Things, or the like, we have heard, when we were Boys from grave Men whom we call'd our Maſters. And becauſe we could never learn if we did not believe without Examination, retain and repeat well, we have believ'd and repeated theſe Impertinences ſo many times, that afterwards we cannot hinder our ſelves from be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieving them and teaching them to others.</p>
               <p n="10">X. If an Ox or any Animal of a new Species ſhould drop from the Clouds, all the Virtuoſo's and curious Wits would make abundance of Reflections on a thing that very little deſerv'd their application. But that all Animals ſhould come out of the Womb of their Mothers in a uniform manner, and according to infinitely wiſe Laws; this is a thing too common to be the ſubject of their Reflections and Enquiries. 'Tis Nature that doth all thoſe wonderful Things. This great Word explains every Thing. We reſt ſatisfied with it; we do not ſuſpend our Judgment. We believe: But what is it that we believe? Why that Nature does every Thing: Nothing is plainer. Shall we doubt of this! Shall we examine things that we have ſaid and heard a Thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſand and a Thouſand times? And what will this bring us to? To meditate? No, that coſts too much Pains. To go to School and learn? No, that Time's paſt. We are now ask'd our Opinion: And therefore our Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vince is now to determine and to judge.</p>
               <p n="11">XI. There would be no Atheiſts or Libertines, if Men would reflect a little, I will not ſay on themſelves, but on the leaſt conſiderable of the Works of God, on a Leaf, a Grain or a Fly. But they have ſeen theſe Won<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders
<pb n="57" facs="tcp:97672:35"/>when they were Children. They have been us'd to them before they could think in Order, before they could reflect and ſuſpend their Aſſent. They have been taught to ſlight and paſs them by without regard. Thus they are ſurrounded with wonderful Works, and do not know it. They are themſelves the Maſter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piece of God's Workmanſhip, and yet they think the leaſt of any thing of examining what they are.</p>
               <p n="12">XII. But the advantage of ſuſpending our Aſſent is much greater in matters of Morality than in any other' Caſe whatſoever. For that which relates to Manners is very little known, and very difficult to be known exactly, becauſe the Principles and Idea's which we have of that matter, are obſcur'd by the Paſſions, which leave us no liberty of Mind, but in reſpect of thoſe Truths which do not much concern us. So that in mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters of Morality we avoid Error almoſt as often as we ſuſpend our Aſſent; and theſe Errors are always of Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſequence. Not but that we are often oblig'd to act, before we know clearly what we ought to do. But whatever we ought to do, we ought never to believe, before Evidence obliges us to it. Nor do I ſay that we muſt always remain in doubt: For there are infinite differences between doubting and believing, which have no particular Names. We doubt when every thing is equally probable. We believe when every thing is evident. But as there are innumerable degrees of Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bability greater and leſs, the Mind muſt place every thing in it's proper Rank, if it would judge rightly. And its deciſions ought always to be guided by Light and Evidence. For tho' a Principle be not evident, yet perhaps it is evident that this Principle is probable. And therefore the Mind ſhould ſuſpend its Aſſent, and examine it, if the time permits. It ſhould look upon it as probable, and give it that degree of probability which Light and Evidence allow it. For in fine, the Judgments of the Will ought not to have a greater la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>titude than the perceptions of the Mind: We ſhould follow the Light ſtep by ſtep, and not go before it. When we judge upon no other ground but becauſe we will judge, and before we are oblig'd to it by Evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence, this Judgment being of our own production, and not proceeding from the action of God within us, is
<pb n="58" facs="tcp:97672:36"/>liable to Error; and tho' it may by Chance be right, yet it is not rightly made, becauſe, as I have ſaid ſeve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral times, we ſhould make uſe of our Liberty <hi>as much as we can.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="13">XIII. Let a Man ſpend but one Year in the Conver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſation of the World, hearing every thing that is ſaid, and believing nothing, retiring every Moment into him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf, to hearken whether the Truth within him ſpeaks the ſame Language, and ſtill ſuſpending his Aſſent till the Light appear: I ſhall reckon ſuch a Man more learned than <hi>Ariſtotle,</hi> wiſer than <hi>Socrates,</hi> and more illuminated than the Divine <hi>Plato.</hi> Nay, I eſteem the facility which he will thereby gain of meditating and ſuſpen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding his Aſſent, more than all the Vertues of the great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt Men among the ancient Heathens; for if he culti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vates a Soil that is not ungrateful, he will gain by his Labour more ſtrength and liberty of Mind than can be imagin'd. What a vaſt difference there is betwixt Reaſon and Opinion; betwixt the Sovereign within which convinces by Evidence, and Men who perſuade by Inſtinct, by their Geſtures, Voice, Air and Behavi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>our; betwixt Men both deceivers and deceiv'd, and the eternal Wiſdom, Truth it ſelf! Let thoſe who have not reflected on theſe things condemn me if they pleaſe, and let them begin their Cenſure by renouncing Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon.</p>
               <p n="14">XIV. But farther, if Men would ſuſpend their Aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent alſo touching matters of Fact, of which they can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not be inform'd by conſulting the inward Truth, but ſeem in a manner oblig'd to believe what they are told; how many miſtakes and diſturbances would they avoid by making a little uſe of their Liberty? There is nothing does more miſchief in the World than the Opinion Men have of Things: But the Opinion they have of Perſons excites alſo an infinite number of Paſſions. Slander, Calumny and falſe Reports, are oftentimes the cauſe of the oppreſſion of Innocence, of irreconcileable Hatreds, and ſometimes alſo of Battels and bloody Wars. A Word ill underſtood and worſe interpreted, is a ſufficient ground for a Challenge with Men of a light and haſty Diſpoſition. They will not ſubmit to have Matters fairly clear'd: Or if they would, People are not always in a Humour to give them this
<pb n="59" facs="tcp:97672:36"/>Satisfaction. What then muſt we do in this Caſe? We ſhould believe nothing that is ſaid, we ſhould ſuſpend our Aſſent, and remember theſe Words of the wiſe Man, "He that is haſty to believe is light in Heart: For it is the greateſt mark of a weak Mind, to believe lightly every thing that is ſaid. Do not we know that the greateſt part of Mankind is apt to Poiſon the moſt in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nocent Words and Actions, I do not ſay out of wilful and deviliſh Malice, but for their Intereſt or Diverſion, to ſhew their Wit, or from the natural Malignity of their Temper? Have we not obſerv'd that almoſt all common Reports prove falſe in the end; and that when it is the intereſt of a Party, that any one ſhould be a Man of Probity and Vertue or the contrary, common Fame diſguiſes and transforms him in a Moment? Let every Man reflect but upon himſelf. How many falſe and raſh Judgments hath he made of every thing that hath been told him of Perſons whom he doth not Love? But let him take notice, that if he once ſuffer himſelf to believe all the Ill he hears, his Imaginations and Paſſions will not be quiet, but will make him believe a great deal more. For the Imagination and Paſſions never ceaſe to communicate their own Diſpoſitions and ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lignant Qualities to the Objects which excite them; as the Senſes imprint on Bodies thoſe ſenſible Qualities with which they themſelves are affected: For elſe how could the Paſſions juſtify all the Extravagances and Wrongs they commit? We muſt not always attribute to others what we feel within our ſelves: This miſcarriage is ſo frequent, that whenever any one ſpeaks of another, we have reaſon to be apprehenſive of falling into it, and to fear that he doth not ſpeak ſo much what is true, as what he believes to be true. So that if we would not be deceiv'd in our Opinions of Perſons, we ſhould ſuſpend our Aſſent, and look upon that which is ſaid of them only as probable. Prudence requires us to diſtruſt Men, and to be always on our guard againſt their Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lignity. But we are not allow'd to condemn them within our ſelves: We muſt leave the quality of Judge and ſearcher of Hearts to God alone, if we will not run the hazard of committing a thouſand Wrongs.</p>
               <pb n="60" facs="tcp:97672:37"/>
               <p n="15">XV. That we may clearly comprehend the neceſſity of endeavouring to gain ſome liberty of Mind, or ſome facility of ſuſpending the aſſent of the Will; we muſt know that when two or more Goods are actually pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent to the Mind, and the Mind determines its choiſe in relation to them, it never fails to chooſe that which at that inſtant appears to be the beſt; ſuppoſing an equality in every thing elſe. For the Soul being ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pable of loving only by the natural tendency which it hath toward Good, muſt of neceſſity love that which hath the greateſt conformity with what it loves irreſiſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly.</p>
               <p n="16">XVI. But we muſt obſerve, That the Soul may ſtill ſuſpend its Aſſent, and not determine it ſelf finally, even when it doth determine it ſelf; eſpecially in regard of falſe Goods. (I ſuppoſe the room which it hath for thinking, not to be taken up by any over-violent Sen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſations or Motions.) For in fine, we may with-hold our Aſſent, till Evidence obliges us to yield it. Now we can never evidently ſee that falſe Goods are true ones, becauſe we can never evidently ſee that which is not. So that tho' we cannot hinder our ſelves from de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>termining in favour of the moſt apparent Goods, yet by ſuſpending our Aſſent, we may love none but thoſe that are moſt ſolid. For we cannot ſuſpend our Judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment without exciting our Attention; and the Attention of the Mind diſpels all thoſe vain appearances and pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>babilities, which deceive the negligent and weak, thoſe ſervile Minds which are ſold to Pleaſure, and will not fight for the preſervation and enlargement of their Liber<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty; in a Word, thoſe who cannot undergo the labour of Examination, but aſſent imprudently to every thing that pleaſes their Concupiſcence. There is nothing then more neceſſary than the liberty of the Mind to make us love none but the true Good, live according to Order, inviolably obey Reaſon, and to procure us true and ſolid Vertue. And all ſuch Occupations as may any way con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tribute to gain the Mind a liberty of ſuſpending its Aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent, till the light of Truth appears, are always very profitable to Men, who have a natural inclination to judge boldly and adventurouſly of every thing, and by conſequence are extremely liable to fall into Error and Diſorder.</p>

How far the right uſe of our Strength and Liberty contributes toward it, by the Light it pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duces in us, by the contemptible Opinion it gives us of our Paſſions, and by the Purity which it preſerves and eſtabliſhes in our Imagination.</hi>
               </head>
               <p n="1">I. THE facility of rendering the Mind attentive, and of with-holding its Aſſent, till Evidence obliges it to give it, are Habits neceſſary for ſuch as would be ſubſtantially Vertuous. But ſolid Vertue, Vertue every way compleat, doth not conſiſt only in thoſe two noble and extraordinary Diſpoſitions of the Mind; there is requir'd beſides an exact Obedience to the Law of God, a general Nicety in all our Duties, a firm and govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing diſpoſition of regulating all the motions of our Hearts and all the actions of our Life by the known Order; in a Word, the love of Order. For what advantage is it to a Man to have ſtrength and liberty of Mind ſuffici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent to diſcover the moſt hidden Truths, and to avoid even the ſmalleſt Errors, if he doth not govern his Acti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons by his Light, if he oppoſes or forſakes the Truth which he knows, and withdraws himſelf from the Obe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dience which he owes to Order, the inviolable, the eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal and divine Law? Certainly this will ſerve only to render him more Criminal, and to enhance his Guilt in the Eyes of him who invincibly loves Order, and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diſpenſably puniſhes every breach of it.</p>
               <p n="2">II. But how muſt we gain this fix'd and ruling Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſition of governing all the motions of our Heart, and all the actions of our Lives by the known Order? What we are to do for this end is evident from that which hath been ſaid in the fourth Chapter. Habits are form'd by Acts: We muſt therefore frequently make firm and conſtant reſolutions of obeying Order, and ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crificing every thing to it. For by often repeating theſe actual Reſolutions, and purſuing them at leaſt in part,
<pb n="62" facs="tcp:97672:38"/>we may by degrees gain ſome kind of habitual Diſpo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſition. This is eaſy enough to be conceiv'd; but it is by no means eaſy to be practis'd. For which way can we frame this heroick Reſolution of ſacrificing even our predominant Paſſion to the divine Law? Certainly it is not poſſible to be done without the aſſiſtance of Grace. A Man without Grace may kill himſelf, he may deſire to return again into Nothing: But Nothing is not ſo ter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rible as that diſconſolate condition of living without that which we love. Nothing is a middle ſtate be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween Happineſs and Miſery: So that we may wiſh not to be, when we are miſerable, and deſperate in our Miſery. But we cannot wiſh to be miſerable, becauſe the deſire of Happineſs is invincible and irreſiſtible. And therefore without a firm Faith, and the hope of enjoy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing a Happineſs more ſolid than that which we part with, Self-love tho' never ſo much enlightned, cannot beget in us a bare reſolution of ſacrificing our predo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minant Paſſion. This is without Diſpute.</p>
               <p n="3">III. Now that this Faith and Hope are the Gifts of God <gap reason="illegible" resp="#UOM" extent="1 word">
                     <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
                  </gap> be prov'd by ſeveral Reaſons, the chief of which I take to be this, That it is naturally impoſſible for a Man who is continually diſtracted by Objects which pleaſe his Senſes, and excite his Paſſions, to have ſo much command over himſelf, as to examine the Truths of Religion, with that attention and perſeve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance which is neceſſary to be fully convinc'd of them and ſubmit to them, unleſs God by a particular favour make him find ſome delight in this kind of application. Nevertheleſs, ſince we may make Nature ſubſervient to Grace a great many ways, we ſhould, out of a Principle of Self-love enlightned, endeavour to retire into our ſelves, to confirm our Faith, and encreaſe our Hope. But theſe Truths require a fuller explica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.</p>
               <p n="4">IV. Every Man invincibly deſires to be Happy, but with a ſolid and durable Happineſs. No Man would be deceiv'd, eſpecially in a matter of ſo great conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quence as eternal Salvation. And therefore every Man who hath already gain'd ſome force and liberty of Mind, or indeed every Man who is not ſo much a Slave to Sin, and ſo much in ſubjection to actual Pleaſure, that he cannot make any reflection on the way which leads'
<pb n="63" facs="tcp:97672:38"/>to Life, ſhould and may ſatisfy himſelf once for all, whether his Being is immortal or not; whether there be a jealous and inexorable God; whether Order is an inviolable Law, and whether every Action confor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mable or contrary to that Law ſhall be infallibly rewar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded or puniſh'd. Self-love enlightned, and the deſire of being ſubſtantially happy, is without doubt a ſuffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient Grace to incline us to make ſome examination of the Truths of Religion. We may deprive our ſelves for a moment of a ſlight Pleaſure, to look after the en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joyment of a ſolid and durable one. For nothing is more reaſonable and more agreeable to Self-love en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lightned, than to be willing to ceaſe from being actu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally happy for ſome time, that we may be ſolidly hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>py to all eternity.</p>
               <p n="5">V. It is not in a Man's own choice to have the Goſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pel preach'd to him. It doth not depend on his own election to happen into a Converſation, or to light of a Book, which may convince and convert him by means of the favourable circumſtances of Grace and of his pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent Condition. But it is, or hath been in his own power to preſerve ſome ſtrength and liberty of Mind, and not ſuffer his Imagination to be corrupted to that degree, as to render Grace when it is given him ineffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctual; and to make him in a manner inſenſible of the taſt of true Good and ſpiritual Delight, through the abun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dance, the ſprightlineſs and force of ſenſible Pleaſures which diſturb and captivate him. For, as I have already ſaid, it is by the means of this ſpiritual Delight, that the Truths of Religion make a lively impreſſion on the Mind. Without this we read the Scripture, like the <hi>Jews,</hi> with a Vail over our Eyes. The Preacher ſpeaks to the Ears; Miracles and Prodigies aſtoniſh the Senſes; but God doth not ſpeak to the Heart. It is Attention that is the natural cauſe of Light. But moſt commonly, as ſoon as Pleaſure ceaſes, the Attention alſo fails; at leaſt that kind of favourable Attention which renders the Light agreeable and lovely, and prepares the Soul for a tendency toward Good; becauſe Pleaſure is the natural Characteriſtick of Good, and the Soul invincibly deſires to be always happy.</p>
               <p n="6">VI. Nevertheleſs, as we deſire to be ſolidly happy, we may in ſome meaſure ſacrifice falſe Pleaſures, tho' pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent,
<pb n="64" facs="tcp:97672:39"/>to ſolid Pleaſures, tho' future: Nay, we may ſeek the latter rather than the former, when the actual hope and the actual appearance of Good are in a reci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>procal proportion to each other. Experience teaches us theſe Truths; for we often quit a ſlight Pleaſure when we hope to enjoy one more ſolid. But becauſe we invincibly deſire to be happy, and to be actually happy, we cannot long reſiſt the actual and continual allurement of ſenſible Pleaſures, how great Strength and Liberty of Mind ſoever we have acquir'd: We cannot be willing to put off our Happineſs till after Death, which the Imagination looks upon as a true annihila<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion; the Imagination, I ſay, which without Grace is always the Miſtreſs of Reaſon, the Governeſs of the Paſſions, and the inward Principle of all the violent Motions which ſhake the Soul. Thus it is evident, that on the one ſide, he that commits Sin, and doth not labour to maintain the Strength and Liberty of his Mind, deſerves Puniſhment; and on the other, that neither the moſt enlightned Law, nor the cleareſt Philoſophy, can impart to the Soul, corrupted and weaken'd by ori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginal Sin, ſufficient ſoundneſs and ſtrength to walk in the way which leads to Happineſs: This St. <hi>Paul</hi> ſhews all through his Epiſtle to the <hi>Romans.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="7">VII. It is neceſſary then that Man who is capable of Reaſon and Happineſs, ſhould make uſe of all the Strength and Liberty of Mind that is left him, to in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>form himſelf of thoſe things that may encreaſe his Faith and ſtrengthen his Hope, which may put him in the way to Happineſs; and without which, as I have ſhewn, it is not poſſible for him ſo much as to form a Reſolu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of Sacrificing his predominant Paſſion. But what! muſt we Sacrifice our predominant Paſſion to be happy? This is a Contradiction; at leaſt, it is very harſh and terrible: It is ſo; but that is when our Paſſion appears dreſt in all its Charms; we muſt therefore ſtrip it of them. I do not ſay, that we muſt Sacrifice it with all thoſe Ornaments which diſguiſe it: On the contrary, ſeeing we would not be deceiv'd, ſeeing we would be ſolidly happy; I ſay we muſt endeavour to know it for what it really is, to diſcover the Ridiculouſneſs of it, which may make us deſpiſe it, or the Deformity of it, which may create in us an averſion for it. This I ſay,
<pb n="65" facs="tcp:97672:39"/>that we ſhould and may by the Strength of our Hope and Faith bring our Mind to ſuch a Temper, that with the help of Grace, it may perform this Sacrifice which appears ſo terrible, with Pleaſure, or at leaſt with Joy and Satisfaction: After all, there is a neceſſity for it. We muſt either unavoidably periſh together with our imaginary Riches, or throw them over-board to arrive happily at the Port, where we ſhall find ſolid and ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtantial Wealth, not ſubject to Storms and Tempeſts.</p>
               <p n="8">VIII. For this end, we muſt ſtudy the Nature of Man; we muſt know our Selves, our Greatneſs, our Weakneſs, our Perfections and Inclinations; we muſt be fully ſatisfied of the Immortality of our Being; we muſt carefully examine the difference between the two Parts of which Man is compos'd, and the admirable Laws of their Union; from thence we muſt raiſe our Minds to the Author of theſe Laws, and the true Cauſe of all that paſſes within our ſelves, and in the Objects that are about us. We muſt contemplate God in thoſe Attributes which are contain'd in the vaſt and bound<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſs Idea of an infinitely perfect Being, and never judge of him with relation to our ſelves; but ſupport the View of our Mind, if there be occaſion, in ſo abſtract<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed and profound a Subject, by the viſible Effects of the univerſal Cauſe: Above all, we muſt examine the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lations which the Conduct of God hath to the Divine Attributes, and find out how his Conduct ought neceſſarily to be the Rule of ours: Finally, we muſt penetrate into his eternal Deſigns, and know at leaſt that he is himſelf the end of his working, and that the immutable Order is his Law. Then we muſt go back again to our ſelves, compare our ſelves with Order, and diſcover that we are wholly corrupted; we muſt be ſenſible and aſham'd of our low and unworthy Inclina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions; and condemn our ſelves as guilty, as Enemies of our God, as not engaging in his Deſigns, as not o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>beying his Law, but the filthy Law of Fleſh and Blood; we muſt humble our ſelves and tremble before a God jealous of his Glory, and a puniſher of Crimes; we muſt dread his juſt and terrible Vengeance, Death and Hell; ſeek for a Mediator with the greateſt concern, and find him at length in the Perſon of Jeſus Chriſt, the only Son of God; who was once offer'd as a Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crifice
<pb n="66" facs="tcp:97672:40"/>upon the Croſs, for the Sins of the World, and is now ſeated at the right hand of the living God, made Lord of all things, and conſecrated a High Prieſt of the true Goods; once put to death as a Malefactor without <hi>Jeruſalem,</hi> and now within the Temple, in the Holy of Holies, before his Face of the Father, always living to make interceſſion for Sinners, and to ſhower down Bleſſings and Graces upon them; but after all, their inexorable Judge in the day of the Vengeance of the Lord; that eternal Day which ſhall put an end to all Time, and fix the meaſures of Good and Evil to all Eternity.</p>
               <p n="9">IX. Can we think of theſe great Truths, and be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vinc'd of them by frequent Meditations, and yet find our Paſſions ſtill the ſame? Can that ſenſible Pomp and thoſe Charms which ſurround them; can they, I ſay, bear that ſtrong and penetrating Light which diffuſes it ſelf in the Mind, when we think of Death and Hell, and the World to come, that heavenly <hi>Jeruſalem</hi> en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lightned with the Splendor of God himſelf, and environ'd with the River of his Pleaſures? Certainly, the thought of Death alone muſt change the whole Face of things in thoſe who have any Senſe left, or retain any Strength and Liberty of Mind. But that unavoidable Alterna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive of two Eternities, ſo oppoſite to each other, which ſucceed our lateſt Moments, muſt needs break all the Deſigns, and blot out all the Ideas which our Paſſions repreſent to us; at leaſt, they cannot poſſibly juſtify their Extravagancies and Irregularities in theſe times of Reflection.</p>
               <p n="10">X. If to thoſe Truths which Reaſon diſcovers when it is guided by Faith, we add that which Reaſon by it ſelf informs us, of the difference between the Soul and the Body, and of the Laws of the Union of theſe two Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtances; it will not be ſo difficult to diſcover the Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lignity of the Paſſions, and to deſpiſe their flattering Careſſes which irreſiſtibly ſeduce weak Minds. For when we reflect ſeriouſly on the movement and work<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of our Machine, we ſometimes chooſe rather to go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vern the Springs of it our ſelves, than to be carried a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>long with its Motions; and when we are fully con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vinc'd, that all the Splendor and all the Charms of ſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſible Objects depend only on the manner in which the
<pb n="67" facs="tcp:97672:40"/>Fermentation of the Blood and other Humours repre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent them to us, the deſire which we have of being ſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lidly happy carries our Thoughts another way, and ſometimes makes us loath and abhor thoſe vain Ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects; vain and contemptible without doubt, as well becauſe the Splendor of them vaniſhes, when the Fer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mentation abates, or when the Circulation of the Blood ſupplies the Brain with Spirits of a different Quality, as for a great many other Reaſons which need not here be alledg'd; they paſs away, and that is ſufficient. But they paſs away in ſuch a manner, that they draw along with them thoſe that faſten themſelves to them, and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtroy them for ever.</p>
               <p n="11">XI. Let every one then examine his predominant Paſſion by the Principles of the true Philoſophy, and thoſe Truths which Faith teaches him, of which he ought to ſatisfy himſelf by a good uſe of Grace and Liberty; (for nothing is more reaſonable than Religion, tho' we ſtand in need oſ ſome help to make us throughly com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehend it, and ſubmit our ſelves to it;) let every one, I ſay, examine by the Light of Reaſon and of Faith, the Paſſion which holds him in Captivity; and he will find in himſelf, ſome deſire, at leaſt, to be deliver'd from its Tyranny: The Enchantmens which bewitch'd him, will vaniſh by degrees; he will be aſham'd of himſelf for being ſo eaſily ſeduc'd, and if the Fermen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation of the Blood and Humours ceaſes for a little while, and the animal Spirits change their Courſe, he will find himſelf ſo diſpleas'd with the Object of his Incli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nations, that he will not be able ſo much as to endure the Preſence of it.</p>
               <p n="12">XII. But notwithſtanding this, we muſt not ceaſe to watch over our ſelves, to diſtruſt our own Strength, and to meditate on thoſe Subjects which render out Paſſions ridiculous and contemptible; for we muſt not imagine our ſelves at liberty, becauſe we are not actu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally ill us'd by them. Our Imagination remains a long time polluted by the impreſſion of the Paſſion which hath once reign'd in us; for the Wounds which the Brain hath receiv'd from the Action of Objects and the Motion of the Spirits, are not eaſily cur'd; the animal Spirits flowing naturally to thoſe parts of the Brain which are moſt open or lie moſt ready to receive them; it is impoſſible to heal the Wounds of the Imagination,
<pb n="68" facs="tcp:97672:41"/>but by continually turning the Courſe of the Spirits which renews them; as it is impoſſible for a Wound in the Body to cloſe up, if you thruſt the Sword which made it, every moment into it, or any thing which renews and enflames it.</p>
               <p n="13">XIII. But the Spirits do not only of themſelves, and as it were fortuitouſly, flow into the Wounds which the Brain hath receiv'd from the Action of ſenſible Ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects; they are determin'd alſo to paſs thither continu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally, by the Pleaſure which the Soul receives from thence, and eſpecially by the admirable Conſtruction of the Machine, which goes on in its Motion, without ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pecting the Orders of the Will, and many times by reaſon of Sin, contrary to them. So that whenever we ceaſe to reſiſt and divert the Courſe of the Spirits, the Paſſions renew and encreaſe their Strength. Now the only way to make a Diverſion and Revulſion in the Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rits, is to ſet before our Minds thoſe Objects, and employ our ſelves in thoſe Thoughts to which different courſes of the animal Spirits are joyn'd, by the Laws of the Union of the Soul and Body: For the Courſe of the Spirits doth not depend immediately on our Will; but only becauſe the Thoughts which determine the Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the Spirits depend on it, as I have ſhewn in the Fifth Chapter. It is impoſſible then to deliver our ſelves from our Paſſions, if we do not carefully avoid the Ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects which excite them, and employ our Minds in ſuch Thoughts as are proper to make them ridiculous and contemptible. But I ſhall treat of this more particularly hereafter.</p>
               <p n="14">XIV. To make Men reflect yet farther on the Truths which I have here ſet down, I think my ſelf oblig'd to add this in particular, That neither the Prayer of Invo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation, nor good Works, no nor the Grace of Jeſus Chriſt, doth heal the Wounds which the Brain receives from the violent and irregular Motion which the Paſſions excite in the animal Spirits: No, the moſt ſublime Grace of Chriſt, that of Baptiſm, that which the Soul receives in the Holy Communion, when it comes to it with the moſt ſanctified Diſpoſitions, do not cure this kind of Diſtempers without a Miracle. It is true, in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed, that the Grace of Juſtification gives us a Right to thoſe Succours which are neceſſary to reſiſt the actual
<pb n="69" facs="tcp:97672:41"/>Aſſault of the Paſſions; but it doth not deliver us from their Attacks, it doth not cloſe the Wounds which the Brain hath receiv'd from the Action of ſenſible Objects. God doth not work Miracles on our Body when he ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtifies us; he ſtill leaves us all our Weakneſſes: Bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſm doth not free us from our Concupiſcence; and the new Chriſtian who is tormented with the Gout, or diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quieted with any Paſſion, doth not find himſelf cur'd of thoſe troubleſome Diſtempers; he only re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceives the aſſiſtance neceſſary to make him bear patient<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly the Pain which afflicts him, and uneaſily, tho brave<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, the Careſſes of the Paſſion which Courts and Flat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters him.</p>
               <p n="15">XV. The ſame thing almoſt may be ſaid of Prayer and good Works; they obtain of God the Succours neceſſary for the Fight, but they do not deliver us from our Miſeries; unleſs it be that continual fighting and reſiſting naturally makes the Spirits take another Courſe, and then the Wounds cloſe up and heal of them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves; for to cure the Wounds of the Brain, as well as thoſe of the other parts of the Body, it is ſufficient that there be nothing to hinder the ſeparated parts from reuniting.</p>
               <p n="16">XVI. Now the Reaſon why Grace doth not deli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver us from our Paſſions, nor Baptiſm from the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinual Aſſaults of our Concupiſcence, is becauſe the power of the Grace of Chriſt appears much more by the continual Victories which the Juſt obtain over their Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>meſtick Enemies; the Merit of the Saints by this means becomes more pure and illuſtrious; and ſince Glory is proportion'd to Merit, the holy City, the eternal Tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple, the great work of Chriſt receives innumerable Beau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties, which it would not have, if our Paſſions did not give us continual Aſſaults. St. <hi>Paul</hi> was juſt, but yet he found in his Fleſh a Law oppoſite to that of the Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit, by which he was animated: He often beſought Chriſt that he would deliver him from that which he calls, <hi>A Thorn in the Fleſh.</hi> But Chriſt anſwers him;
<note place="margin">2 Cor. 12. v. 8, 9.</note> 
                  <q>My Grace is ſufficient for thee; for it is in Weak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs that my Power appears, and that Vertue purifies it ſelf. Therefore St. <hi>Paul</hi> gloried in Infirmities, in Perſecutions, in Reproaches, that the Power of Chriſt, as he ſaith,</q> might reſt upon him.</p>
               <pb n="70" facs="tcp:97672:42"/>
               <p n="17">XVII. Let us not wonder therefore if the Sacraments leave the Body in the ſame condition in which they found it, and ſtrengthen only the inward Man, of which we have no perfect Knowledge; nor let us deſpair, becauſe we ſee our ſelves ſtill inſulted and ill-us'd by ſinful Paſſions, if we always continue ſtedfaſt in our Faith, contented with our Hope, and thereby unſhaken in our Reſolution of Sacrificing all Things to God. But if we would, as indeed we ought, (for we ought always to avoid Dangers;) if we would, I ſay, deliver our ſelves from thoſe troubleſome Motions which the Paſſions excite in us, we muſt abſolutely make uſe of that Remedy which I have preſcrib'd, and fill our Minds with ſuch Thoughts as may make a Diverſion and Revulſion in the animal Spirits, and render the Paſſions ridiculous and contemp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tible; there is no other way. But thoſe who either upon Philoſophical grounds, or by motives of Self-love enlightned, condemn the Paſſions as Criminal, muſt not preſently imagine that they are juſt in the ſight of God, nor too haſtily eſteem themſelves above their Brethren. We muſt, as much as we can, make Nature ſubſervient to Grace; but we muſt ſtill remember, that Nature doth not juſtify, and that Grace many times operates in Mens Minds and converts them, and yet they perceive no alteration in them.</p>

The fear of Hell is as good a motive as the deſires of eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal Happineſs. We muſt not confound the Motive with the End.

               </head>
               <p n="1">I. WE cannot obtain nor preſerve Vertue or the Love of Order, but by actual reſolutions of Sacrificing every Thing to it; becauſe naturally Habits are got and maintain'd by Acts: But we cannot frame a reſolution of Sacrificing our predominant Paſſion, without a lively Faith, and a firm Hope; eſpecially when this Paſſion appears with all its Charms and Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lurements. And therefore ſince it is Light and Under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding which illuminates Faith, ſtrengthens Hope, and diſcovers to the Mind the ridiculouſneſs and defor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mity of the Paſſions, we ſhould continually meditate on the true Goods, and ſeek and carefully lay up in our Memory the Motives which may induce us to love them, and to deſpiſe tranſient Enjoyments; and that with ſo much the greater diligence, becauſe the Light is ſubject to our Wills; and if we live in Darkneſs, it is moſt commonly our own fault. I think I have ſuffici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ently prov'd theſe Truths.</p>
               <p n="2">II. But when our Faith is not lively, nor our Hope ſtrong enough to make us reſolve to Sacrifice a Paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion, which hath got ſuch a Dominion over our Heart, that it corrupts our Mind every Moment, and draws it to its Party; the only thing we ought to do, and per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>haps the only thing we can do in this Caſe, is to ſeek for that in the fear of Hell, and the juſt Indignation
<pb n="72" facs="tcp:97672:43"/>of an avenging God, which we cannot find in the hope of an eternal Happineſs; and in the Motion which that Fear excites in us, to pray to the Saviour of Sinners, that he would encreaſe our Faith and Confidence in him, not ceaſing in the mean time to meditate on the Truths of Religion and Morality, and on the Vanity of tranſitory Enjoyments; for without this we cannot be ſenſible of our Miſeries, nor call upon our Deliverer. Now when we find in our ſelves ſt<gap reason="illegible" resp="#UOM" extent="2 letters">
                     <desc>••</desc>
                  </gap>ngth enough to form an actual reſolution of Sacrificing our Paſſions to the Love of Order; then, tho' according to the Principles which I have laid down in the foregoing Chapters, we may through the aſſiſtance of Grace, by repeating the like Acts, abſolutely acquire Charity, or the habitual and ruling Love of the immutable Order; yet it is better, without delay, to come to the Sacraments, and in that actual Motion which the Holy Ghoſt inſpires in us, to waſh away our Sins by Penance. This is un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doubtedly the moſt compendious and certain way to change the Act into a Habit; the Act, I ſay, which is tranſient and doth not work Converſion, into a Habit which remains and which juſtifies. For God doth not Judge us according to that which is actual and tranſitory, but according to habitual and permanent Diſpoſitions; and by the Sacraments of the New Teſtament, we receive juſtifying Charity, which gives us a Right to the true Goods, and the aſſiſtances neceſſary for the obtaining of them. Theſe Truths I ſhall here explain either by certain Principles, or by Evidence, or by Faith.</p>
               <p n="3">III. I think I have ſhewn in ſeveral places, and by ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veral ways, That God always executes his Deſigns by general Laws, the Efficacy of which is determin'd by the action of occaſional Cauſes. I have prov'd this Truth by the Effects of thoſe ſecond Cauſes which are known to us, and I think I have demonſtrated it from the Idea of God himſelf, becauſe his Action ought to bear the Character of his Attributes. And therefore I refer the Reader for this Matter to my other Writings. But if Reaſon could not lead us to this Truth, yet the Holy Scripture would not ſuffer us to doubt of it, in relation to the Subject which I now treat of: For the Scripture teaches us that Jeſus Chriſt, as Man, is not only the meritorious, but alſo the diſtributive or oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caſional
<pb n="73" facs="tcp:97672:43"/>Cauſe of all Graces; that by his Sacrifice of himſelf he hath gain'd a Right over all the Nations of the World, to make uſe of them as Materials in build<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the Spiritual Temple of the Church, of which the ſtately Temple of <hi>Solomon</hi> was but a Shadow and a Fi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gure; and that now, and ever ſince the day of his Aſcen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion, he makes uſe of that Right, and raiſes that eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal Temple to the glory of his Father, by the Power which he receiv'd from him in the day of his Victories, when he was made High Prieſt of the true Goods, af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter the irrevocable Order of <hi>Melchiſedech.</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Eph. 4.15, 16.</note> Chriſt is the Head of the Church; he continually infuſes into the Members of which it is compos'd,

Joh. 13.5.</note> the Spirit which gives it Life and Holineſs: He is the Advocate, the Mediator, the Saviour of Sinners: He is in the Holy of Holies, always Living to make interceſſion for us, and all his Prayers and Deſires are heard. In a word, he himſelf tells us, That all Power was given to him in Heaven and in Earth. Now he did not receive this Power, as God equal to the Father, but as Man like unto us; and God communicates his Power to the Creatures no farther, than as he executes their Wills, and by them his own Deſigns; for God alone is the true Cauſe of every thing that is done both in Nature and Grace. Thus it is certain from the Scripture, that Jeſus Chriſt as Man is the <hi>occaſional cavſe</hi> which deter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mines the efficacy of that general Law, whereby God would Save all Men in and by his Son.</p>
               <p n="4">IV. It is neceſſary that we ſhould be well convinc'd of this Truth which is eſſential to Religion, by reading the <hi>New Teſtament,</hi> and particularly the Epiſtle to the <hi>Hebrews:</hi> And having, as I think, ſufficiently prov'd it in my Treatiſe of <hi>Nature and Grace,</hi> and in my <hi>Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtian Meditations,</hi> I ſhall not inſiſt any longer upon it. I write for Philoſophers, but they are Chriſtian Philo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſophers, ſuch as receive the Scripture and the infallible Tradition of the Univerſal Church; and I endeavour to explain the Truths of Faith by clear and unequivo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cal Terms. This makes me ſay, that Jeſus Chriſt as Man and High Prieſt of the true Goods, is the <hi>occaſional</hi> cauſe of Grace. I might have call'd him the <hi>natural, inſtrumental, ſecond, diſtributive</hi> Cauſe, or have made uſe of ſome other more common Term: But the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moneſt
<pb n="74" facs="tcp:97672:44"/>Terms are not always the cleareſt. Tho' People fancy they underſtand them perfectly, yet commonly they ſcarce know what they ſay, when they uſe them; and if they would take the pains to examine theſe which I have mention'd they would find that the Term of <hi>natural</hi> Cauſe raiſes a falſe Idea; that that of <hi>inſtru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mental</hi> is obſcure; that of <hi>ſecond</hi> ſo general, that it gives no diſtinct Idea to the Mind; and that of <hi>diſtri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>butive</hi> at leaſt equivocal and confus'd. Whereas this which I have made uſe of, [the occaſional cauſe of Grace] hath, I think, none of theſe defects, at leaſt as to thoſe Perſons for whom alone I writ the <hi>Treatiſe of Nature and Grace,</hi> tho' many others have taken upon them to judge of it who ſcarce underſtand the Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciples which I have there laid down. For this Term denotes preciſely that God who doth every thing as the <hi>true</hi> cauſe, which I think I have prov'd in ſeveral places, imparts his Grace only by Jeſus Chriſt, the Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crifice once offer'd on the Croſs, and now glorified and conſummated in God, the High Prieſt of good Things to come, the Head of the Church, and the Architect of the eternal Temple. It clearly denotes that the ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neral Law of the Order of Grace is that God would Save all Men in and by his Son: A Truth which S. <hi>Paul</hi> repeats upon all occaſions, as being the Foun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dation of the Religion which we profeſs. It may be I have not light on the proper Word to expreſs clearly that which Faith teaches us concerning Jeſus Chriſt. But let not any one therefore be offended with me, I am willing to be Taught, and ſhall never contend with Heat and Obſtinacy for Terms. When any one will give me better, I will make uſe of them. But I think that the cleareſt are the beſt. For we ſhould conſider, that Words are deſign'd only to expreſs our Thoughts. So that thoſe Words which clearly expreſs falſe Conceptions, are in themſelves preferable to thoſe which expreſs the moſt ſolid Thoughts confuſedly: Eſpecially when Men make uſe of them as I do, with a deſign to explain and prove clearly thoſe Truths which Philoſophers themſelves do not very well comprehend.</p>
               <p n="5">V. But I deſire that the World would do me that Juſtice, or have ſo much Charity for me as to believe, that my introducing ſome Ideas which I make uſe of
<pb n="75" facs="tcp:97672:44"/>in this Treatiſe, proceeds neither from a reſentment againſt any Perſons, nor from a deſire of juſtifying my own Notions or ways of Expreſſion. I believe that thoſe who have not done me Juſtice, had no deſign to injure me; and that if they judg'd a little too haſtily of my Opinion from Terms which they do not underſtand, it was their love to Religion which prompted them to it: A Love which cannot be too great, and which is hard to be kept within Bounds, when it is ſo fervent as I know it to be in ſome of my Adverſaries. The Reader will pardon this ſhort Digreſſion, I return to my Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject.</p>
               <p n="6">VI. God never acts without Reaſon, and there are but two general Reaſons which determine him to act: Order, which is his inviolable Law, and thoſe general Laws which he hath eſtabliſh'd, and which he conſtantly obſerves, that ſo his Actions may bear the Character of his Attributes. Therefore ſeeing that nothing happens in the Creatures, which God doth not do, and that as to Sinners, the immutable order of Juſtice doth not re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quire that God ſhould do any good to them; the Sin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner cannot obtain any Good, much leſs Grace, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out having recourſe to the occaſional cauſe, which de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>termines the true cauſe to communicate it to Men. So that there is a kind of neceſſity that we ſhould know diſtinctly and preciſely what is that occaſional cauſe, that ſo we may make our applications to it with con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fidence, and obtain thoſe aſſiſtances, without which, as I have ſhew'd, it is not poſſible ſo much as to form a reſolution of ſacrificing our predominant Paſſion to the Law of God.</p>
               <p n="7">VII. When a ſick Man is in fear of Death, and is fully ſatisfied that there is but one certain Fruit which can reſtore him to his Health again; his Fear is ſuffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient to make him uſe ſome endeavours to get that Fruit. The firſt Man was immortal only becauſe he knew that the Fruit of the Tree of Life could preſerve vigour and give Immortality, and that it was in his power to Eat of it. So when we are in fear of Hell, and know diſtinctly that Chriſt is the Tree of Life, whoſe Fruit gives Immortality, or to ſpeak clearly and unequivocally to Philoſophers, when we know that Chriſt is the occa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſional cauſe of Grace, the actual fear of eternal Death
<pb n="76" facs="tcp:97672:45"/>is ſufficient to make us call upon him, and pray that he would with relation to us, form ſuch deſires as may determine God the true cauſe to deliver us from our Miſeries.</p>
               <p n="8">VIII. I ſay once again, for we cannot imprint this Truth too deeply in our Minds, that Jeſus Chriſt as Man is alone the occaſional cauſe of Grace, and it is more certain that his deſires procure for us the Spirit which quickens us, than it is that to Morrow the Sun will diffuſe its Light, or the Fire its Heat and Motion. The Fire hath ſometimes reſpected the Bodies of Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tyrs; the Sun is often eclips'd, and every Night leaves us in Darkneſs: But Chriſt never pray'd in vain. For if before he had compleated his Sacrifice, by which he merited the Glory he now poſſeſſes, ſpeaking to his Father,
<note place="margin">Joh. 11.42.</note> he ſaid of himſelf; <hi>I knew that thou heareſt me always;</hi> Certainly now that he is entred by his Blood into the Holy of Holies, and is ordain'd a High Prieſt of true Goods, it would be a very great infidelity to want confidence in him. But it may be objected, that the Fire communicates its Heat by the neceſſity of na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tural Laws, and that we cannot come near it without feeling its action; whereas on the contrary it depends on the Will of Chriſt whether he will Pray for thoſe which call upon him. This difference is true. But what! Shall we doubt of the goodneſs of Chriſt? Can we forget that he bears the Character of the Saviour of Sinners? Shall we diſtruſt the promiſes which he hath made us in ſo many places of his Goſpel?
<note place="margin">Heb. 4.14, 15, 5, 9.</note> Let us remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber that we have in him a High Prieſt who hath expe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rienc'd our Miſeries, and ſympathizes with our Infirmi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties: That he deſires nothing ſo much as to finiſh his great Work, the eternal Temple, of which we ſhould be living Stones;
<note place="margin">Luk. 15.7.</note> and that, as he ſaith himſelf, there is Joy in Heaven over one Sinner that repenteth: And in thoſe Thoughts let us approach with Confidence the Throne of his Grace, the true Mercy-ſeat. Let us ask, and we ſhall receive: Let us ſeek, and we ſhall find; let us knock, and we ſhall at laſt have leave to enter. Whoſoever ſhall call on the name of the Lord ſhall be Sav'd.
<note place="margin">Joel 2.32.</note> The Scripture teaches us theſe Truths.</p>
               <pb n="77" facs="tcp:97672:45"/>
               <p n="9">IX. So then, ſuppoſing that a Man fears the terrible Judgments of the living God, believes in Chriſt, and calls upon him as his Saviour, and that in fine he hath receiv'd from him ſufficient Strength to form that noble reſolution of renouncing his predominant Paſſion: That which he ought to do in this caſe, is to come without delay, and throw himſelf at the Feet of the Prieſt, that by the Sacrament of Penance he may receive abſolution of his Sins, and juſtifying Charity, which Sinners re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive by this Sacrament, when they come to it in the motion which the Holy Ghoſt inſpires, tho' he doth not yet dwell in them.</p>
               <p n="10">X. To prove the Truth of what I here aſſert, I ſay, that Chriſt after his Reſurrection appear'd to his Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtles, and ſaid to them: <hi>Peace be unto you.
<note place="margin">Joh. 20.21.</note> As my Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther hath ſent me, even ſo ſend I you. And when he had ſaid this, he breathed on them, and ſaid, Receive ye the Holy Ghoſt. Whoſe Sins ye do remit, they are remitted unto them,</hi> &amp;c. From whence it is manifeſt, firſt that the Apoſtles, and conſequently Prieſts have power to for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>give Sins; this I think cannot be denied. Secondly, that this Sacrament as alſo all thoſe of the <hi>New Teſtament,</hi> tho' for other Reaſons than theſe which I here make uſe of, do confer juſtifying Charity, or an habitual and ru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling Love of the immutable Order. For God doth not judge of a Man by that which he knows to be tranſient and actual in him, but by fix'd and permanent Diſpo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſitions. Therefore an actual love of Order doth not juſtify, but only an habitual Love. For God who in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>violably loves Order, cannot love a Heart that is irre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gular, and more diſpos'd toward evil than toward good. Now the Prieſt hath power to forgive Sins: Therefore he hath power to render a Sinner acceptable to God. His Abſolution then changes the Act into a Habit and a per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manent Diſpoſition. For the Prieſt cannot judge of the ſtate of the Penitent, but only of his actual Reſolution. He cannot judge of the Penitent but only by the decla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration which the Penitent himſelf makes to him, and the Penitent himſelf cannot tell whether the love which he hath for Order be habitual or not. For a Man cannot judge of himſelf but by the inward ſenſe he hath of him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf, and this ſenſe repreſents to him only the acts which
<pb n="78" facs="tcp:97672:46"/>he actually perceives, and not the Habits if they be not form'd in him.</p>
               <p n="11">XI. From hence it is evident, that it is a pernicious Error to believe that the Abſolution of the Prieſt deli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vers the Penitent only from the eternal Puniſhment due to Sin. For the Prieſt having no way to be morally aſſur'd that a Penitent is juſtified in the ſight of God, could never give Abſolution but at a venture, if the Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crament did not change the Act or the actual reſolution of which we have an inward ſenſe, into an habitual Diſpoſition, which is not perceiv'd. And beſides, how could this be a power of forgiving Sins, to leave the Sinner in the Death of Sin, and to do good only to the Righteous? It is certain then that there is in Jeſus Chriſt a permanent and efficacious deſire in conſequence of the power which God hath given him, by making him the occaſional cauſe of Grace; that the ſtate of the Penitent is chang'd by the abſolution of the Prieſt; and that he is deliver'd from the guilt of Sin, as well as from the eternal Puniſhment which is due to it.</p>
               <p n="12">XII. Certainly, if we compare God's two Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nants with Men together, to diſcover their ſeveral rela<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, the Bleſſings promis'd by the Law, with thoſe which Chriſt hath merited for us, and of which he is the diſpenſer; we ſhall ſee plainly that as the Author of the Law gave a Right by his promiſes to temporal Goods, ſo Jeſus Chriſt the Mediator of the new Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant muſt alſo give a Right to real and eternal Goods: And therefore our Sacraments muſt operate, in thoſe who receive them Grace or juſtifying Charity, which alone gives a Right to theſe true Goods. For it is cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain, that God who loves Order, cannot give Heaven to thoſe who are more diſpos'd to Evil than to Good, and are actually in Diſorder. After all, the Council of <hi>Trent</hi> hath determin'd the ſame thing which I here aſſert.
<note place="margin">Seſs. 7. Can. 8 Seſs. 14. Chap 4. Cap. 5.</note> It is an Article of our Faith, that the Sacraments of the <hi>New Teſtament</hi> operate Grace, or juſtifying Cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity; and that the Sinner who comes to the Sacrament of Penance by the motion which the Holy Ghoſt inſpires in him, a motion which doth not juſtify, for the Holy Ghoſt doth not yet dwell in him, as the Council de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clares, and for thoſe reaſons which I have ſet down; that the Sinner, I ſay, truly receives the habitual Cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity
<pb n="79" facs="tcp:97672:46"/>of Juſtification by the efficacy of the Sacrament, which the Saviour of Sinners hath inſtituted to deliver them from the captivity of Sin.</p>
               <p n="13">XIII. So then it is evident, that the Sinner who is made contrite by any motive whatſoever, for it mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters not what it is, when he feels himſelf touch'd with Repentance, and hath obtain'd by his Prayers or other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe, ſufficient ſtrength to form the generous reſolution of ſinning no more, or of renouncing his predominant Paſſion, ought ſpeedily to have recourſe to Penance, that ſo he may receive by this Sacrament, that which in all probability he could never obtain by the ordinary way of Prayer.</p>
               <p n="14">XIV. I know very well that many People condemn the fear of Hell, as a motive of Self-love which can never produce any Good: Notwithſtanding I have made uſe of it, as being the moſt lively and the moſt common Motive to excite us to do thoſe things which may contribute to our Juſtification. I know that they reject this motive as uſeleſs, and on the contrary approve only of the hope of an eternal Reward, as a holy and reaſonable Motive, by which moſt good Men are ani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mated to Vertue, according to thoſe Words of <hi>David,</hi> who was always ſo full of Fervour and Charity; I have enclin'd my Heart to perform thy Statutes alway,

                  <hi>be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe of the Reward.</hi> Notwithſtanding, to deſire to be Happy, or to deſire not to be Miſerable, is the ſame thing, there is nothing more eaſy to be conceiv'd than this. The fear of Pain and the deſire of Pleaſure are both of them but motions of Self-love. Now Self-love in it ſelf is not Evil. God continually produces it in us. He irreſiſtibly enclines us to Good, and by the ſame Motion irreſiſtibly diverts us from Evil. We can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not hinder our ſelves from deſiring to be Happy, and conſequently from deſiring not to be Miſerable. So then the fear of Hell, and the hope of Heaven are two Motives equally Good: Only that of Fear hath this advantage over the other, that it is more lively, ſtrong and efficacious: becauſe generally, ſuppoſing all other things equal, we fear Pain, more than we deſire Plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure: Of this every Man may conſult himſelf. Nor let any one ſay that the eternal Reward comprehends in it the viſion of God; and therefore the hope of Reward
<pb n="80" facs="tcp:97672:47"/>is a good Motive: For the ſame Reaſon will ſerve for Fear. Hell excludes the Viſion of God; and the fear of not enjoying God, is the ſame thing with the deſire or hope of enjoying him. So that if we compare Plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure with Pain, the loſs of God with the enjoyment of him, fear is as good a Motive as deſire or hope. But beſides, it hath this advantage, that it is proper to awaken the moſt drowſy and ſtupid; and for this rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon it is that the Scripture and the Fathers make uſe of this
<note n="*" place="margin">By Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive I under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtand that which excites in the Soul any actual motion of that kind of Love which I call'd be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>for love of Union.</note> Motive upon all occaſions. For after all, it is not properly the Motive which regulates the Heart, but the love of Order. Every Motive is grounded on Self-love, on that invincible deſire of being happy, which God continually inſpires into us, in a Word on our own Will; for we cannot Love but by our Will. And a Man that burn'd with a deſire of enjoying the preſence of God, to contemplate his Perfections, and have a ſhare in the felicity of the Saints, would ſtill de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerve the puniſhment of Hell, if he had a diſorder'd Heart, and refus'd to ſacrifice his predominant Paſſion to Order. As on the contrary, one that was indifferent as to eternal Happineſs, if that were poſſible, but in all other things was full of Charity, or the love of Order in which Charity is comprehended or of the love of God above all other things, he I ſay, would be a juſt Man and ſolidly Vertuous; for as I have already prov'd at large, true Vertue, or a conformity to the Will of God, conſiſts wholly in an habitual and ruling Love of the eternal and divine Law, the immutable Order.</p>
               <p n="15">XV. A Man ought to love God not only more than this preſent Life, but alſo more than his own Being: Order requires it. But he cannot be excited to this love any other way, than by the natural and invincible love which he hath for Happineſs; He cannot love but by the love of Good or his own Will. Now he cannot find his Happineſs in himſelf: He can find it only in God, becauſe there is nothing but God alone capable of acting on him, and making him happy. Again, it is better not to be than to be Miſerable: It is better then, not to be than to be out of favour with God: Therefore we ought to love God more than our ſelves, and pay him an exact Obedience. There is a difference between the Motives and the End. We are excited by
<pb n="81" facs="tcp:97672:47"/>the Motives to act for the End. It is the greateſt Crime imaginable to place our End in our ſelves. We ſhould do every thing for God. All our Actions ſhould be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fer'd to him from whom alone we have the power to do them: Otherwiſe, we violate Order, we offend God, and are guilty of Injuſtice. This is undeniable. But we ſhould ſeek for the motives which may make us love Order, in that invincible Love which God hath given us for Happineſs, For ſince God is Juſt, we cannot be happy, if we are not obedient to Order. It matters not whether thoſe Motives be of Fear or of Hope, if they do but animate and ſupport us. The moſt lively, the moſt ſtrong, ſolid and durable are the beſt.</p>
               <p n="16">XVI. There are ſome People that make a Thouſand extravagant Suppoſitions, who for want of a true Idea of God, ſuppoſe, for inſtance, that he hath deſign'd to make them eternally Miſerable. And in this Suppoſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, they think themſelves oblig'd to love this Chimera of their own Imagination above all Things. This per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plexes them extremely: For indeed how is it poſſible to love God, when they deprive themſelves of all the rational Motives of loving him; or rather, when in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtead of him, they repreſent to themſelves a terrible Idol with nothing in it capable of being Lov'd? God would have us Love him ſuch as he is, and not ſuch as it is impoſſible for him to be. We muſt love an infinitely perfect Being, and not a dreadful Phantom, an unjuſt God; a God, powerful indeed, abſolute and ſupreme, ſuch as Men wiſh to be, but without Wiſdom or Good<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, Qualities which they do not much eſteem. For the ground of theſe extravagant Fancies, which frighten thoſe that form them, is that they judge of God by the inward ſenſe which they have of themſelves, and with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out conſidering imagine that God may form ſuch De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſigns as they find themſelves capable of forming. But they have no Reaſon to fear; if there were ſuch a God as they Fancy, the true God, who is jealous of his Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour, would forbid us to adore and love him: They ſhould endeavour to ſatisfy themſelves, that perhaps there is more danger of offending God, in giving him ſo horri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble a form, than in deſpiſing that Phantom of their own. We ſhould continually ſeek for thoſe Motives which
<pb n="82" facs="tcp:97672:48"/>may preſerve and encreaſe in us the love of God, ſuch as are the Threatnings and Promiſes which relate to the immutable Order; Motives proper for Creatures who invincibly deſire to be happy, and of which the Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture alſo is full; and not deſtroy thoſe reaſonable Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tives, and render the Fountain of all Good odious. For the reaſon why the Devils cannot love God, is becauſe they have now, through their own fault no motive to Love-him: It is decreed, and they know it, that God will never be good in reſpect of them. For ſince it is impoſſible to love any thing but Good, or that which is capable of giving Happineſs, they have no motive to love God, but they have to hate him with all their power as the true but moſt juſt cauſe of the Miſeries which they ſuffer. They cannot love God, and yet they are oblig'd to love him, becauſe Order requires it; Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der, I ſay, which is the inviolable Law of all intelli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gent Beings, in what ſtate ſoever they be, Happy or Miſerable. Therefore, ſince they deſerve that which they ſuffer, they are in a ſtate of diſorder, and will be incorrigible in their Wickedneſs to all eternity. What I have ſaid of this matter is only to ſhew, that no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing can be Evil, nor ought to be rejected, which may make us love God, have recourſe to Jeſus Chriſt, and live according to Order. If I am deceiv'd, I deſire to be better inform'd, for this is a matter of great conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quence.</p>

               <head>CHAP. IX. <hi>The Church in its Prayers Addreſſes its ſelf to the Father by the Son, and why. We ſhould Pray to the Bleſſed Virgin, Angels and Saints, but not as occaſional cauſes of inward Grace. The Angels, and even the Devils have power over Bodies, as occaſional cauſes. By this means the Devils may tempt us, and the Angels pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mote the efficacy of Grace.</hi>
               </head>
               <p n="1">I. JESUS CHRIST conſider'd in his humane Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, being alone the <hi>true Propitiatory,</hi> or the <hi>occa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſional</hi> cauſe of Grace, as I have ſhewn in the former Chapter, it is evident that we muſt apply our ſelves to him alone for the obtaining of it. Nevertheleſs we may call upon God, nay, we muſt Worſhip or call upon none but him as the <hi>true</hi> cauſe of our Good. We may Pray to the Bleſſed Virgin, to Angels and Saints, not as <hi>true</hi> cauſes, nor as <hi>occaſional</hi> or diſtributive cauſes of Grace, but as Friends of God, or interceſſors with Je<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſus Chriſt. We may alſo Pray to the Angels, as our protectors againſt the Devil, or as <hi>occaſional</hi> cauſes of certain effects, which may diſpoſe us to receive inward Grace profitably. But I muſt explain thoſe Truths more at large, for they are of the greateſt Importance; for regulating our Prayers, our Worſhip, and all our Du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties.</p>
               <p n="2">II. The Church being guided by the Spirit of Truth generally addreſſes her Prayers to the Father by the Son; and when ſhe addreſſes them to the Son, ſhe con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiders him as equal to the Father, and conſequently calls upon him not ſimply as he is Man, but as he is God and Man. This appears from the ordinary con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cluſions of our Prayers: <hi>Through Chriſt our Lord,</hi> or, <hi>through Jeſus Chriſt our Lord,</hi> or, <hi>who liveſt and reigneſt one God,</hi> &amp;c. For ſince God alone is the <hi>true</hi> cauſe, who by his own power can do all that we deſire, it is neceſſary that the greateſt part of our Prayers and all our Worſhip ſhould be refer'd to him. But as he never acts but when the <hi>occaſional</hi> cauſes which he hath ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointed
<pb n="84" facs="tcp:97672:49"/>determine the efficacy of his Laws, it is fit that the manner of our calling upon him ſhould be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formable to this Notion of him.</p>
               <p n="3">III. If Jeſus Chriſt as Man did not intercede for Sinners, it would be in vain for them to call upon him. For ſince Grace is not given to Merit, the immutable Order of Juſtice doth not oblige God to grant it to Sin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners who Pray for it. It muſt therefore be the occaſio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal cauſe which obliges him to do it, in conſequence of the Power given to this cauſe by the eſtabliſhment of the general Laws of the Order of Grace: Becauſe, as I ſaid before, God never acts but when the immuta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble Order requires it, or when the occaſional or par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular Cauſes oblige him to it. But tho' Chriſt alone as Man be the particular cauſe of the good Things which we receive, yet if the Prayers of the Church were always Addreſs'd directly to him, this might give Men ſome occaſion of Error, and induce them it may be to Love him as he is Man, with that kind of Love which is due only to the true Power, and to Worſhip him even without regard to the divine Perſon in which his humane Nature ſubſiſts. Now Adoration and Love of Union, which are Honours belonging to Power, are due to the Almighty alone: For Chriſt himſelf challenges our Adoration and this kind of Love, only as he is at the ſame time both God and Man.</p>
               <p n="4">IV. Therefore the Church hath very great reaſon to Addreſs her Prayers to God, the only <hi>true</hi> Cauſe; but through Chriſt, who is the <hi>occaſional</hi> and diſtributive Cauſe of the good Things which we Pray for. For tho' Sinners never receive Grace, but when Chriſt Prays for them by his Deſires either Actual or Habitual, Tranſient or Permanent, yet we muſt always remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber that it is God alone who gives it as the true Cauſe, that ſo our Love and Devotion may be ultimately re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fer'd to him alone. Nevertheleſs, when we apply our ſelves to the true and general Cauſe, it is the ſame thing as if we did it to the particular and diſtributive Cauſe: Becauſe Chriſt as Man being the Saviour of Sinners, Order requires that he ſhould be acquainted with their Prayers; and he is ſo far from being Jea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lous of the Honour which we give to God, that he
<pb n="85" facs="tcp:97672:49"/>himſelf as Man always acknowledges his Impotence and Subordination; and will never hear thoſe, who like the <hi>Eutychians,</hi> look upon his humane Nature as tranſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>form'd into the Divine, and ſo take from him the qua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lities of Advocate, Mediator, Head of the Church, and High Prieſt of the true Goods. Thus we ſee on one ſide, that to make our Prayers effectual, it is not abſolutely neceſſary that we ſhould know the Truths, which I have here explain'd ſo preciſely and diſtinctly; and on the other, that the Churches proceeding agrees perfectly with the fundamental Vertue of Religion and Morality, namely, that God alone is the final Cauſe of all Things, and that we cannot have acceſs to him, but by Jeſus Chriſt our Lord. This I think will eaſily be granted.</p>
               <p n="5">V. But the caſe of the Bleſſed Virgin, Angels and Saints, hath ſomewhat more difficulty in it. Never<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>theleſs the ſenſe of the Church is, that they know our Neceſſities when we call upon them, and that being in favour with God, and united to Chriſt their Head, they may by their Prayers and Deſires ſollicite him to deliver us from our Miſeries. Nay it ſeems to be be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>yond Diſpute from the example of S. <hi>Paul</hi> and all the Saints, who conſtantly recommended themſelves to one another's Prayers. For if the Saints on Earth as yet full of Imperfection, can by their Prayers be beneficial to their Friends; I ſee no ſufficient reaſon to deny the Saints in Heaven this Power. Only we muſt obſerve, That they are not occaſional cauſes of inward Grace. For this Power was given to Chriſt alone, as the Architect of the eternal Temple, the Head of the Church, the ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſary Mediator, in a Word as the particular or di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtributive cauſe of the true Goods.</p>
               <p n="6">VI. So then we may Pray to the Bleſſed Virgin, to Angels and Saints, that they would move the love of Chriſt on our behalf. And probably there are ſome cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain times of Favour for each particular Saint, ſuch as are the Days on which the Church celebrates their Feſtivals. It is poſſible alſo, that as natural or occaſio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal Cauſes, they may have a Power of producing thoſe effects which we call Miraculous, becauſe we do not know the Cauſes of them; ſuch as the curing of Diſeaſes, plentiful Harveſts, and other extraordinary changes in
<pb n="86" facs="tcp:97672:50"/>the poſition of Bodies, which are Subſtances inferiour to Spirits, and over which it ſhould ſeem that Order requires or at leaſt permits them to have ſome Power, as a reward of their Vertue, or rather as an inducement to other Men to admire and imitate it. But tho' this be not altogether certain as to Saints, yet I think it cannot be doubted as to Angels. This Truth is of ſo great Importance on ſeveral Accounts, that I think it neceſſary to give a brief explication of it from the manner of God's proceeding in the execution of his De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſigns.</p>
               <p n="7">VII. God could not act but for his own Glory; and not finding any Glory worthy of himſelf but in Jeſus Chriſt, he certainly made all Things with reſpect to his Son. This is ſo evident a Truth, that we cannot poſſibly doubt of it, if we do but reflect a little on it. For what <gap reason="illegible" resp="#UOM" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>elation is there between the Action of God and the product of that Action, if we ſeparate it from Chriſt by whom it is Sanctified? What proportion is there between an unhallow'd World which hath no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing of Divinity in it and the Action of God which is wholly Divine; in a Word, between Finite and Infi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nite? Is it poſſible to conceive, that God who cannot act but by his own Will, or the Love which he bears to himſelf, ſhould act ſo as to produce nothing wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thy of himſelf, to create a World which bears no pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portion to him, or which is not worth the Action where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by it is produc'd?</p>
               <p n="8">VIII. It is probable then, that the Angels immedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ately after their Creation, being aſtoniſh'd to find them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves without a Head, without Chriſt, and not being able to juſtify God's deſign in Creating them, the Wicked ones imagin'd ſome Worth in themſelves with relation to God, and ſo Pride ruin'd them: Or ſuppo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing, which ſeems moſt probable, that the eternal Word, to juſtify to them the Wiſdom of God's proceeding, acquainted them that he had a Deſign to make Man, and to joyn himſelf to the two Subſtances of which Man is compos'd, Soul and Body, thereby to Sanctify the whole Work to God, which is alſo compos'd of none but theſe two ſorts of Beings: The wicked An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gels oppos'd this Deſign, and would not Worſhip Je<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſus Chriſt, nor ſubmit to one whom they thought their
<pb n="87" facs="tcp:97672:50"/>equal, or even inferiour to them in his own Nature, how much ſoever that might be exalted by the hypo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtatick Union. Upon this, two oppoſite Parties were form'd in the Workmanſhip of God, S. <hi>Michael</hi> and his Angels, and Satan and his Miniſters, the Founda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the two eternal Cities, <hi>Jeruſalem</hi> and <hi>Babylon.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="9">IX. The Angels then having a Power over Bodies, either by the Right of their own Nature, for Order ſeems to require that ſuperior Beings ſhould act on thoſe that are below them: Or rather by the Decree which God had eſtabliſh'd, to execute his own Deſigns by them as occaſional Cauſes of certain Effects, to build the holy City, the heavenly <hi>Jeruſalem,</hi> his great Work, in which the Angels are employ'd under the Wiſe and only Architect our Lord Jeſus Chriſt, ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to the Holy Scriptures: And by this means to manifeſt the Power of his well-beloved Son, who wanted Enemies to Fight with and overcome; which Power of his never appear'd more illuſtrious, than when he dethron'd the rebel Prince who had brought all the World under ſubjection to his Laws. (For the Power of a Deliverer is never more Conſpicuous, than when our Enemy hath gain'd an abſolute Dominion over us, when we have no Power to reſiſt him, and have groan'd a long time under his Tyranny.) The Angels, I ſay, having an immediate Power over Cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poreal Subſtances, and by them an indirect Power over ſpiritual Subſtances, as ſoon as our firſt Parents were Created, the wicked Angels tempted the Woman in that manner which we all know, probably grounding their Temptations on the known Deſign of God, that the World ſhould unite it ſelf to the Soul of Man to Sanctify him, as may be gather'd from theſe Words, <hi>Ye ſhall be as Gods, knowing Good from Evil.</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Gen. 3.5.</note> For I do not ſee that illuminated Minds could have any other Motive formally to diſobey God, but that of being tran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſlated from a profane State to one Divine and worthy of God, by a particular union with the univerſal Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon, the Eternal Word, for whom and by whom they knew that they were firſt form'd, and by whom they were to be form'd anew, they who were all of their kind upon the Earth, and the Heads of that Poſterity which might ſpring from them. Thus the Devils con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quer'd
<pb n="88" facs="tcp:97672:51"/>them, and became Maſters of them and all their Poſterity: And thereby, tho' indeed they promo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted the Deſign of the Incarnation of the Word, for the Sin of the firſt Man made it neceſſary upon ſeveral Accounts, yet they thought they had overthrown it; imagining belike that the Union with God was to be merited by an exact Obedience to his Orders.</p>
               <p n="10">X. We muſt know, that not only for Reaſons which I have given in my <hi>Search of Truth,</hi>

And being in the Hands of the Devil, who hath a Thouſand ways to ſtir it up by the Power which he hath over Bodies, he reign'd by the help of that till the coming of Chriſt, who by his Sacrifice merited the quality of High Prieſt of the true Goods, and of the occaſional cauſe of in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward Delight, which alone can counterpoiſe the force of Concupiſcence, and render that Inſtrument of the Devils Conqueſts uſeleſs to him: For ſince Man invin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cibly deſires to be happy, there is nothing can cure his Heart corrupted with ſenſible Pleaſures, but the Unction of Grace, the Earneſt or Fore-taſt of true Joys. For the good Angels having no Power to infuſe into the Heart of Man the Grace of Senſe, and the bad ones having a Power to ſtir up Concupiſcence in it; Sin muſt neceſſarily have reign'd, not only among the ido<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>latrous Nations, but even among the <hi>Jews</hi> alſo. And therefore we find that that People was very Groſs and Carnal, always prone to Idolatry, and frequently re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lapſing into it, notwithſtanding the extraordinary Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racles which S. <hi>Michael</hi> and his Angels wrought in fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour of them, and in ſpight of the Promiſes and Threats of temporal Good and Evil, which were the Objects of their Concupiſcence. For the Angels themſelves pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerv'd the Worſhip of the true God, among thoſe that follow'd their Conduct, and kept them in their Duty, only by motives of Self-love, and by promiſing them
<pb n="89" facs="tcp:97672:51"/>ſuch Enjoyments, as true Chriſtians think altogether unworthy of their Love.</p>
               <p n="11">XI. There are ſeveral Reaſons why the Law did not promiſe the true Bleſſings; but one of the chiefeſt is, that ſince this ſort of Enjoyments cannot be the Object of Concupiſcence, the knowledge and worſhip of the true God would have been ſoon loſt among the <hi>Jews,</hi> and that choſen People reduc'd to a Handful of Men, belonging to Chriſt, and Sanctified in every Age by in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward Grace. But it was neceſſary that the knowledge of the true God ſhould be preſerv'd with ſome luſtre among the <hi>Jews,</hi> a prophetical People, and an unex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceptionable Witneſs of the Truths of Religion, in ſpight of all the Power and Artifices of the Prince of this World, till at length the only begotten Son of God, for and by whom all things were made, ſhould come down from Heaven to change the Face of Things over all the Earth, and to open the ſurpriſing and wonder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful Scene of God's Conduct. A Scene which will end with the indiſſoluble Marriage of the Bride and Bride<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>groom, who ſhall enjoy together in Heaven an eternal Felicity in the midſt of the divine Brightneſs, ſinging Songs of Praiſe without ceaſing to the Glory of him, who ſhall have put all their Enemies under their Feet by the invincible Power of his Arm, and by ways perfectly ſuitable to his Wiſdom and other Attributes.</p>
               <p n="12">XII. Theſe great Truths do without doubt deſerve to be prov'd and explain'd more at large, but this is not a place for it. My Deſign here is chiefly to ſhew,
<note place="margin">Heb. 1.14.</note> that the Angels are Miniſters of Jeſus Chriſt, <hi>ſent forth,</hi> as S. <hi>Paul</hi> ſaith, <hi>to Miniſter for them who ſhall be Heirs of Salvation:</hi> And that, as occaſional Cauſes; for God communicates his Power no other way to the Crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures; they have a Power, not of giving inward Grace, but of producing in the Bodies, and by their means in the Souls wihch are united to them, certain effects, which may promote the efficacy of Grace, and keep Men from thoſe Stumbling-blocks which the Devils continually lay in their way: For, as the Pſalmiſt ſaith,
<note place="margin">Pſal. 91.11, 12.</note> 
                  <hi>He hath given his Angels charge over thee, to keep thee in all thy ways: They ſhall bear thee up in their Hands, leſt thou daſh thy Foot againſt a Stone.</hi>

The <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>nion of the Soul with God is immediate, not that of the Soul with the Body. An Explication of ſome general Laws of the <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>nion of the Soul and Body, neceſſary for the right underſtanding the reſt of this Treatiſe.</hi>
               </head>
               <p n="1">I. IN the Fifth, Sixth and Seventh Chapters, I have ſpoken at large of the occaſional Cauſe of <hi>Light;</hi> and in the two laſt, I have endeavoured to ſhew what is the occaſional Cauſe of the Grace of <hi>Senſe,</hi> and what we muſt do to obtain it. And therefore, ſeeing there is nothing beſide Light and Senſe which determines the Will, or the tendency which the Soul hath toward Good in general; all that now remains in relation to the Means of acquiring or preſerving the habitual and ruling Love of the immutable Order, is to explain the Laws of the Union of the Soul and Body, or the oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caſional Cauſes of all thoſe lively and confus'd Senſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, and thoſe indeliberate Motions which unite us to our Body, and by that to all the Objects which are a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout us. For, to make us love Order and to acquire Vertue, it is not ſufficient to obtain the Grace of Senſe, which alone can ſtir the Soul and put it in Motion to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward the true Good; but we muſt alſo manage our ſelves ſo, that this Grace may work in our Hearts with its full Efficacy. For this end we muſt carefully avoid the occaſional Cauſes of thoſe Senſations and Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions which reſiſt the Operation of Grace, and ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times render it altogether ineffectual. This is the moſt general Principle of all that I ſhall ſay in the Firſt Part of this Diſcourſe.</p>
               <p n="2">II. The Soul of Man hath two eſſential and natural Relations; one to God, the true Cauſe of all that paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes within him; the other to his Body, the occaſional Cauſe of all thoſe Thoughts which relate to ſenſible Objects. When God ſpeaks to the Soul, it is to unite
<pb n="92" facs="tcp:97672:53"/>it to himſelf; when the Body ſpeaks to it, it is only for the Body to unite the Soul to ſenſible Good: God ſpeaks to the Soul to enlighten and render it perfect; the Body only to darken and corrupt it, in favour of it ſelf: God by the Light, conducts the Soul to its Happineſs; the Body by Pleaſure, involves the whole Man in its ruin, and throws him headlong into Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſery. In a word, tho' it is God that doth every thing, and tho' the Body cannot act upon the Soul, no more than the Soul can upon the Body, but as an occa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſional Cauſe, in conſequence of the Laws of their Union, and for the Puniſhment of Sin, which without medling with thoſe Laws, hath chang'd the Union in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to a Dependence; yet we may ſay, that it is the Bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy which darkens the Mind, and corrupts the Heart; for the Relation which the Soul hath to the Body is the Cauſe of all our Errors and Diſorders.</p>
               <p n="3">III. Notwithſtanding we ſhould be throughly con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vinc'd of this, and never forget it, that the Soul can have no immediate Relation but to God alone, and that it cannot be united directly to any thing but to him; for the Soul cannot be united to the Body, but as it is united to God himſelf. It is certain for very many Reaſons, that if I feel, for inſtance, the pain of a Scratch, it is God that acts in me, tho' in conſequence of the Laws of the Union of the Soul and Body; for thoſe Laws derive their force from the Operation of the Divine Will, which alone is capable of acting in me: But the Body by it ſelf cannot be united to the Soul, nor the Soul to the Body. They have no Rela<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion to one another, nor any one Creature to another: I ſpeak of Relations of Cauſality, ſuch are thoſe which depend on the Union of the Soul and Body. It is God that doth every thing; his Will is the Union of all Unions; the Modifications of Subſtances depend on him alone, who gives and preſerves their Being. This is an eſſential Truth, which, I think, I have ſufficient<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly prov'd in another place.</p>
               <p n="4">IV. But tho' the Soul cannot be united immediately to any Thing but God, yet it may be united to the Creatures by the Will of God, who communicates his Power to them, in making them occaſional Cauſes for the production of certain Effects. My Soul is united
<pb n="93" facs="tcp:97672:53"/>to my Body, becauſe on one ſide my Will is made the occaſional Cauſe of ſome changes which God a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lone produces on it; and in the other, becauſe the changes which happen in my Body are made occaſional Cauſes of ſome of thoſe which happen in my Soul.</p>
               <p n="5">V. Now God hath eſtabliſh'd theſe Laws for many Reaſons which are unknown to us. But of thoſe which we do know, one is, that God in following them, acts in a uniform and conſtant manner, by general Laws, by the moſt ſimple and wiſeſt ways; in a word, he Acts in ſuch a manner as admirably bears the Chara<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cter of his Attributes. Another Reaſon is, becauſe the Body of Man is his proper Sacrifice; for it ſeems to Sacrifice it ſelf by Pain, and to be Annihilated by Death. The Soul is in a State of Probation in the Bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy; and God who deſires in ſome meaſure to be me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rited, and to proportion Rewards to Merits, doth by the Laws of the Union of the Soul and Body, a ſim<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple, general, uniform and conſtant Method, furniſh us with various ways of Sanctifying our ſelves, and Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riting the true Goods. I have explain'd theſe Truths elſewhere, but it is neceſſary to remember them here.</p>
               <p n="6">VI. This kind of Union of the Soul with God, which hath no Relation to the Creatures, is look'd upon by many People as a groundleſs Imagination. For the Operation of God not being ſenſible, we think we an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwer and reprove our ſelves, when it is the univerſal Reaſon which anſwers and reproves us in the moſt ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cret part of our ſelves. It is certain, that he who knows not what Truth and Order is, knows not this Union, tho' perhaps it may act in him; as he who doth not love Truth, nor obey Order, breaks the U<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion, tho' perhaps he knows it.</p>
               <p n="7">VII. But as for that kind of Union of the Soul with God, which relates to the Creatures, we believe it real, but we have a wrong Notion of it. For we im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>agine that we receive from the Objects that which comes from God alone: The Cauſe of this Miſtake is the ſame with that of the former: The Divine Operation not being viſible, we attribute to the Objects which ſtrike our Senſes, all that we feel in their Preſence; tho' they are no otherwiſe preſent to the Soul, than as God, who is more preſent to us than we are to our
<pb n="49" facs="tcp:97672:54"/>ſelves, repreſents them to us in his own Subſtance, which is the only intellectual Subſtance, the only Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance capable of acting on us, and of producing in us all thoſe Senſations which render intellectual Ideas ſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſible, and make us judge confuſedly, not only that there are Bodies, but alſo that they are thoſe Bodies which operate on us, and make us happy, which is the moſt general Cauſe of all our Miſcarriages.</p>
               <p n="8">VIII. We would always be happy, and never miſera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble: Actual Pleaſure cauſes actual Happineſs, and Pain, Miſery. Now we feel Pleaſure and Pain in the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſence of corporeal Objects, and believe thoſe Objects to be the true Cauſes of them. So that there is a ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſity almoſt that we ſhould fear and love them: Nay, tho' we are convinc'd by Metaphyſical and cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain Demonſtrations, that God alone is the true Cauſe; yet this doth not give us Strength enough to ſlight and diſregard them, when we actually enjoy them. For the judgments of the Senſes work more powerfully on us than the moſt ſolid Reaſons; becauſe it is not Light, ſo much as Pleaſure which ſtirs the Soul and puts it in Motion.</p>
               <p n="9">IX. So then it is evident, that to preſerve a ruling Love of the immutable Order, we muſt on the one hand uſe all our endeavours to ſtrengthen this kind of Union of the Soul with God, which hath no Relation to ſenſible Objects; and on the other, we muſt ſlacken, as much as we can, that kind of Union which relates to Bodies, Subſtances inferiour to ours, which are ſo far from being able to make us perfect, that they have no power to act on us, nor corrupt us; but only be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe the Sin of our firſt Parent hath brought in Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cupiſcence, which conſiſts wholly in the Loſs we have ſuſtain'd of the power to ſtop, or ſuſpend the Laws of the Communication of thoſe Motions, by which the Bodies that are about us act on that Body which we animate, and by that on our Mind, in conſequence of the Laws of the Union of the Soul and Body.</p>
               <p n="10">X.
<note place="margin">Chriſtian Meditat, 13, 14, &amp;c.</note> I think I have ſufficiently prov'd already, at leaſt as to ſome Perſons, that ſince all the Motions of the Soul depend on Light and Senſe, to excite in us that Motion which carries us toward God, and keeps us united to him; it is neceſſary that we ſhould continually
<pb n="95" facs="tcp:97672:54"/>exerciſe our ſelves in the Labour of Attention, the oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caſional Cauſe of Light; and frequently call upon Je<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſus Chriſt, the occaſional Cauſe of the Grace of Senſe. I ſhall now examine the Means whereby we may di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miniſh the Union that is between Us and the Crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures, and hinder them from having any ſhare with God in our Mind and Heart: For we are ſo plac'd be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween God and corporeal Objects, that we cannot move toward them, without departing from God; and the breaking off our Correſpondence with them, is ſuffici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent to unite us to God, through the continual influ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence which Chriſt ſheds on his Members.</p>
               <p n="11">XI. That which I ſhall ſay of this matter is not ſo neceſſary for thoſe that have read and conſider'd the Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciples which I have laid down in the <hi>Search of Truth:</hi> And if all Men were capable of ſo much Reaſon as to think methodically, or at leaſt had ſo much Juſtice as to believe that an Author hath thought of the Subject he treats of more than they; I ſhould not be oblig'd to repeat in general, what I have already ſaid or prov'd in other places, and in various manners. No body reads <hi>Apollonius</hi> or <hi>Archimedes,</hi> that hath not learnt <hi>Euclid;</hi> becauſe he can underſtand nothing of Coni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cal Sections, without knowing the common Elements of Geometry; and in Geometrical matters, when a Man doth not underſtand a thing, he knows he doth not underſtand it. But in matters of Morality or Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion, every one, I know not why, thinks himſelf ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficiently capable of comprehending whatever he reads: So that everyone takes upon him to judge, without con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſidering, that Morality, for inſtance, I mean Morality demonſtrated or explain'd by Principles, is to the Know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge of Man, what the Science of curve Lines is to that of ſtrait Lines.</p>
               <p n="12">XII. Wherefore I think it requiſite in this place, to ſuppoſe certain Principles which I have prov'd elſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>where, and which are neceſſary for the ſequel of this Diſcourſe. This will perhaps illuſtrate many Things which I have ſaid, and which I very much fear have not well been underſtood; but theſe ſuppoſitions are not deſign'd for thoſe who have conſider'd the Principles which I have elſewhere explain'd, or fully comprehend what I have ſaid hitherto. They may go on to the next Chapter, and ſave themſelves a needleſs Labour.</p>
               <pb n="96" facs="tcp:97672:55"/>
               <p n="13">XIII. Firſt then, I take it for granted, that to have a right Notion of the Union of the Soul and Body, we muſt not confound the Ideas of theſe two Subſtances, as moſt do, who join them together by extending the Soul to all the parts of the Body, and attribute to the Body all the Senſations which belong to the Soul. The Union of the Soul and Body conſiſts in the mutual and recipro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cal Action of theſe two Beings, in conſequence of the Operations of the Divine Will, which alone can change the modifications of Subſtances. The Soul thinks, and is not exended. The Body is extended, and doth not think: Therefore the Soul cannot be united to the Bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy by Extenſion, but only by Thinking; nor the Bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy to the Soul by Senſation, but only by Situation and local Motion. The Body is wounded, but the Soul feels it. The Soul fears an Evil, and the Body flies from it. The Soul would move the Arm, the Arm im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mediately moves it ſelf; and the Soul ſees and feels it. Thus there is a mutual Correſpondence between cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain Thoughts of the Soul, and certain Modifications of the Body, in conſequence of thoſe natural Laws which God hath eſtabliſh'd, and which he condantly ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerves. Herein conſiſts the Union of the Soul and Body: The Imagination may raiſe other Ideas of all this: But this Correſpondence is undeniable, and is ſufficient for my purpoſe. So that I neither do, nor ought to build on uncertain Foundations.</p>
               <p n="14">XIV. Secondly, I ſuppoſe it to be known, that the Soul is not join'd immediately to all the parts of the Body, but only to one part, which anſwers to all the reſt, and which I call, without knowing what it is, the <hi>Principal Part;</hi> ſo that, notwithſtanding the Laws of the Union of the Soul and Body, a Man may have his Arm cut off, and yet have no thought ariſe in his Soul Correſpondent to it; but it is not poſſible that the leaſt change ſhould happen in the <hi>Principal Part</hi> of the Brain without cauſing alſo ſome alteration in the Soul. This is verified by Experience; for ſometimes parts of the Body are cut off without being felt, becauſe then the Motion of the Amputation doth not communicate it ſelf to the <hi>Principal Part.</hi> As on the contrary, thoſe that have loſt an Arm, often feel a real pain in that very Arm which they have not, becauſe there is the ſame
<pb n="97" facs="tcp:97672:55"/>Motion in the <hi>Principal Part</hi> of the Brain, as if the Arm was hurt!</p>
               <p n="15">XV. The firſt Man before his Sin, had an abſolute power over his Body; at leaſt he could, when he pleas'd, hinder the Motion or Action of Objects from commu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nicating it ſelf to the principal part of the Brain, from the Organs of the Senſes which might be touch'd by thoſe Objects; and this he did probably by a kind of revulſion, ſomewhat like that which we make in our ſelves, when we would fix our Attention on thoſe Thoughts which diſappear in the preſence of ſenſible Objects.</p>
               <p n="16">XVI. But I ſuppoſe in the Third place, that we have not now that power; and therefore to obtain ſome Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berty of Mind, to think on what we will, and love what we ought, it is neceſſary that the principal part ſhould be calm and without agitation, or at leaſt that we ſhould ſtill be able to ſtop and turn it which way we pleaſe. Our Attention depends on our Will; but it depends much more on our Senſes and Paſſions. It is a very difficult thing not to look upon that which touches, not to love that which pleaſes; that which touches, I ſay, and pleaſes the Heart. The Soul is ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver ſooner tir'd, than when it fights againſt Pleaſure, and makes it ſelf actually Miſerable.</p>
               <p n="17">XVII. Fourthly, I ſuppoſe it to be known, that the principal part is never touch'd or ſhaken in an agreeable or diſagreeable manner, but it excites in the animal Spirits ſome Motion proper to carry the Body toward the Object which acts upon it, or to ſeparate it from it by flight; ſo that thoſe Motions of the Fibres of the Brain which relate to Good or Evil, are always fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low'd by ſuch a courſe of the Spirits as diſpoſes the Body rightly with relation to the preſent Object; and at the ſame time thoſe ſenſations of the Soul which are correſpondent to thoſe agitations of the Brain, are fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low'd by ſuch motions of the Soul as anſwer to this courſe of the Spirits. For the impreſſions or motions of the Brain are in reſpect of the courſe of the Spirits, what the ſenſations of the Soul are in reſpect of the Paſſions; and theſe Impreſſions are to the Senſations, what the motion of the Spirits is to the motion of the Paſſions.</p>
               <pb n="98" facs="tcp:97672:56"/>
               <p n="18">XVIII. Fifthly, I ſuppoſe that Objects never ſtrike the Brain without leaving ſome marks of their Action, nor the animal Spirits without leaving ſome Tracks of their Courſe; that theſe Tracks or Wounds are not eaſily clos'd up or effac'd, when the Brain hath been of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten or forcibly ſtruck, and when the Courſe of the Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rits hath been violent, or hath often begun again in the ſame manner: That Memory and corporeal Habits con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſt in nothing elſe but thoſe Tracks or Impreſſions which cauſe in the Brain and other parts of the Body, a par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular facility of obeying the Courſe of the Spirits; and that by this means the Brain is hurt, and the Ima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gination polluted, when we have had the enjoyment of Pleaſures, without apprehending the danger of Familia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity with ſenſible Objects.</p>
               <p n="19">XIX. Laſtly, I ſuppoſe that we conceive diſtinctly, that when many of theſe Tracks have been made at the ſame time, we cannot open any one of them, without opening all the reſt in ſome Meaſure; whence it comes to paſs, that there are always many acceſſory Ideas which preſent themſelves confuſedly to the Mind, ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving a Relation to the principal Ideas to which the Mind particularly applies it ſelf: There are alſo many confus'd Senſations and indirect Motions that accompa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny the principal Paſſion which moves the Soul, and car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries it toward ſome particular Object. There is no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing more certain than this connection of Impreſſions, with one another, and with the Senſes and Paſſions. Any one that hath but the leaſt Knowledge of the Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture of Man, and will make but the leaſt reflection on the inward Senſe he hath of what paſſes within himſelf, may diſcover more of theſe Truths in an Hour, than I can tell him in a Month; provided he doth not confound the Soul with the Body, in making the Union betwixt them, and carefully diſtinguiſhes the Properties of which the thinking Subſtance is capable, from thoſe which be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>long to the extended Subſtance. And I think it neceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſary to Advertiſe the Reader, That this kind of Truths is of very great importance, not only for the diſtinct Conception of what I have hitherto ſaid, and ſhall here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>after ſay, but generally for all the Sciences that have any Relation to Man. Having handled this Subject at large, in the <hi>Search of Truth,</hi> particularly in the Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond
<pb n="99" facs="tcp:97672:56"/>Book, I thought not to have ſaid any thing of it here; and if theſe Suppoſitions ſeem obſcure to the Reader, and do not give him light enough to compre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hend clearly what I ſhall ſay in the remaining part of this Treatiſe, I muſt refer him to that Book; for I can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not perſuade my ſelf to give a long Explication of the ſame thing over and over.</p>

But it is needleſs to prove here that to procure our own Death, is a Crime, which will be ſo far from reuniting us to God, that it will for ever ſeparate us from him. It is lawful to deſpiſe Life, and even to wiſh for Death, that we may be with Chriſt, as St. <hi>Paul</hi> does: Having a deſire to be diſſolv'd,
<note place="margin">Phil. 1.23.</note> and to be with Chriſt. But we are oblig'd to preſerve our Health and Life; and it is the Grace of Chriſt that muſt deliver us from Concupiſcence, or that Body of Death, which joyns us to the Creatures. The ſame Apoſtle cries our, O wretched Man that I am!

               <p n="2">II. It is certain,
<note place="margin">Exod 33.20.</note> that we muſt die before we can ſee God and be united to him; for no Man can ſee him, and live, ſaith the Scripture. But we truly die, ſo far as we quit the Body, as we ſeparate our ſelves from the
<pb n="100" facs="tcp:97672:57"/>World, and ſilence our Senſes, Imagination and Paſſions, by which we are united to our Body, and by that to all thoſe that ſurround us. We die to the Body and to the World, when we retire into our ſelves, when we conſult the inward Truth, when we unite our ſelves and are obedient to Order.
<note place="margin">Job 28.21.</note> The eternal Wiſdom is hid from the Eyes of all <hi>Living.</hi> But thoſe who are <hi>Dead</hi> to the World and to Themſelves, who have cru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cified the Fleſh with its diſorder'd Luſts, who are cru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cified with Chriſt, and to whom the World is cru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cified;

               <p n="3">III. But thoſe who live not only the Life of the Body, but alſo the Life of the World; who live in the enjoyment of Pleaſures, and ſpread themſelves as it were over all the Objects that are about them, can ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver find out Truth.

We muſt begin and continue our Sacrifice, and expect from God the Conſummation and Reward of it. For the Life of a Chriſtian here on-Earth is a conſtant Sacri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fice, by which he continually offers up his Body, his Concupiſcence and Self-love, to the Love of Order; and his Death, which is precious in the Sight of God, is the day of his Victories and Triumphs in Jeſus Chriſt, raiſed from the dead, the forerunner of our Glory, and the model of our eternal Reformation.</p>
               <p n="4">IV.
<note place="margin">Rom. 6.6.</note> St. <hi>Paul</hi> tells us, That our old Man is already crucified with Chriſt; for by the Sacrifice which Chriſt hath offer'd on the Croſs, he hath merited for us, for us, I ſay, particularly who have been waſhed in his Blood by Baptiſm, all the Graces neceſſary to balance,
<pb n="101" facs="tcp:97672:57"/>and even to diminiſh, by degrees, the weight of Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cupiſcence; ſo that Sin no longer reigns in us but by our own Fault. Let us not therefore think to excuſe our Slothfulneſs by imagining that we are not able to reſiſt the Law of the Fleſh, which continually rebels againſt the Law of the Mind. The Law of Sin would have an abſolute Dominion over the Motions of our Heart, if Chriſt had not deſtroy'd it by his Croſs. But we who are dead and buried to Sin, by Baptiſm;
<note place="margin">Rom. 6.4, v. 11.</note> who are juſtified and rais'd to life again in Jeſus Chriſt glorified; who are animated by the influence of our Head, by the Spirit of Chriſt, and by a Power wholly Divine; we, I ſay, ought not to believe that Heaven forſakes us in our Combats; and that if we are over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come, it is for want of Succours. Chriſt never neg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lects thoſe that call upon him; 'tis impious to believe it; for all the Scriptures ſay,

               <p n="5">V. It is certain, that we could never be glorified and ſeated in Heaven with Jeſus Chriſt, we could not have eternal Life abiding in us, we could not be Heirs of God, and Joint-heirs with Chriſt, Citizens of the holy City, and adopted Children of God himſelf, all which things the Apoſtles ſay of Chriſtians, if God were not faithful in his Promiſes, if he ſuffer'd us to be tempted above our Strength;
<note place="margin">1 Cor. 10.13.</note> which St. <hi>Paul</hi> alſo forbids us to believe. But we may truly ſay, That we are already glorified in Chriſt, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> becauſe in effect it depends only on our ſelves, to preſerve by Grace, the Right which the ſame Grace gives us to future Bleſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſings; and it is a kind of brutiſh ſtupidity in a Man, which one would think ſhould aſtoniſh a rational and ſpiritual Being, to loſe infinite Happineſs by his own Fault, and incurr eternal Damnation through his own Negligence.</p>

But to put this Deſign in execution, according to the Advice which St. <hi>Paul</hi> here gives, we muſt labour all our life in the Mortification of our Senſes, we muſt endeavour with the utmoſt Diligence to keep our Imagination pure and undefil'd, we muſt regulate all the Motions of our Paſſions by Order; in a word, we muſt diminiſh the weight of Sin, which by the actual Efforts of Concupiſcence provok'd and ſtir'd up, is able to balance the ſtrongeſt Graces, and to ſeparate us from God. Mortify therefore your Members which are upon the Earth. If we do what depends on us, Grace will work in our Heart with its full Efficacy, we ſhall die in the ſenſe of St. <hi>Paul,</hi> and our life being hid with Chriſt in God, ſhall appear with Glory, when Chriſt himſelf ſhall appear cloth'd with Majeſty and Honour.

               </p>
               <p n="7">VII. Of all the Exerciſes proper to promote the Ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficacy of Grace, there is no one more neceſſary than that of the Mortification of the Senſes; for it is our own Body alone that unites us to all other Bodies. It is chiefly by the Senſes that the Soul ſtretches it ſelf, as I may ſay, to all the parts of the Body, and by the Ima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gination and Paſſions it is carried abroad, and extends it ſelf to all the Creatures. But as Objects are pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſented to the Mind by the Senſes, the Imagination and Paſſions ſuppoſe and depend on them. For it is cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain, that the corporeal Image of a ſenſible Object (I do not here ſpeak of Mathematical Figures) is nothing but the Impreſſion and Motion which that Object hath made in the Brain by means of the Senſes; which Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſion is renewed by the Action of the Imagination, or the Courſe of the Spirits. And as for the Paſſions, they cannot be excited but by the Motion of the animal Spirits, which always ſuppoſes that the Brain, the Maga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zene of theſe Spirits, is ſhaken either by the Senſes or the Imagination: So that he who mortifies his Senſes, attacks the very Foundation of the Union of the Soul with the Body, or rather of its dependence on it; he weakens the animal Life, and diminiſhes the weight of
<pb n="103" facs="tcp:97672:58"/>Sin, Concupiſcence; he promotes the Efficacy of Grace, which alone can reunite us to our firſt Principle: Fi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nally, he procures himſelf that kind of Death, without which, as the Scripture ſpeaks, it is not poſſible to ſee God.</p>
               <p n="8">VIII. The moſt capacious of all the Senſes, that which miniſters to all the reſt, and without which, the Imagination and Paſſions would be but faint and languiſhing, is the Sight. We need but reflect a little on our ſelves, and on the uſe we may make of our Eyes, to be convinc'd that they expoſe us daily to a thouſand Dangers. One indiſcreet look is certainly ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficient to throw us into Hell. It made <hi>David</hi> fall into an Adultery, which afterwards engag'd him in a Mur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der: <hi>Eve</hi> ſuffer'd her ſelf to be ſeduc'd by the Devil, becauſe ſhe ventur'd to look fixedly on the forbidden Fruit, and found it <hi>pleaſant to the Eyes.</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Gen. 3.6.</note> If they had diſtruſted their Senſes, as fallacious, and rejected their Teſtimony, they had, both of them, preſerv'd their Innocence. I think it not much to my preſent purpoſe, to enlarge on the miſchievous effects of the Sight, and from thence to prove the neceſſity of ſhutting our Eyes in many Caſes. I rather chooſe to examine Things in their firſt Principles, and to ſhew the uſe we may law<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully make of all our Senſes in general, which I ſhall confine within the ſtraiteſt Bounds that can poſſibly be ſet to it.</p>
               <p n="9">IX. One of the Principles which I think I have de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monſtrated ſeveral ways in the Firſt Book of the <hi>Search of Truth,</hi> is this; That our Senſes are given us only for the preſervation of our ſenſible Being: In relation to this end, they are perfectly well regulated; but with reſpect to the uſe which the World makes of them, there is nothing more falſe, deceitful and irregular. To prove this, we muſt conſider that we are compos'd of a Soul and a Body, and that we have two ſorts of Good to look after, that of the Soul and that of the Body. The Good of the Soul is found out by the Light; for it is the true Good: That of the Body is diſcover'd by Senſe, for it is a falſe Good; or rather no Good at all. If Men knew ſenſible Objects only as they are in themſelves, and without a ſenſible per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ception of that which is not really in them, they could
<pb n="104" facs="tcp:97672:59"/>not poſſibly ſeek after them and fill themſelves with them, without regret and a kind of deteſtation; and if they had a ſenſe of the true Good, different from what it really is, and without knowing the true Nature of it, they would love it ſenſually and not meritoriouſly. For the Soul neither can, nor ought to live but by the intellectual Subſtance of Reaſon; and the Body can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not receive Nouriſhment and Growth but from Bodies. Intellectual Goods do not ſuit with the mechanical Frame of the Body, and ſenſible Goods diſorder the Soul: Thus Light and Evidence are to the Goods of the Soul, what Senſe and Inſtinct are to thoſe of the Body. This, I think, cannot be denied.</p>
               <p n="10">X. The reaſon of all this is, that God created the Soul only for himſelf: He did not make it that it ſhould employ it ſelf about ſenſible Objects, nor that it ſhould preſerve and govern by Reaſon the Body which it <hi>Informs.</hi> If we would know diſtinctly and rationally, the infinite Relations that are between the Bodies which ſurround us, and that which we animate; if we would know, for inſtance, when we ought to eat, how much, and what kind of Food is preciſely neceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſary to preſerve our Health and Life, we muſt do no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing elſe but ſtudy Phyſicks; and certainly we ſhould not live very long, at leaſt Children would not, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe they want Experience. But Hunger informs us of the neceſſity of Food, and thereby regulates the quantity of it pretty near the matter. Once it did it truly and exactly, and would do ſo ſtill, if we would eat the Fruits of the Earth juſt as God provides them for us. The Taſte is a ſhort and unqueſtionable Tryal, whether ſuch and ſuch Bodies are proper for Nouriſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment or not. Without knowing the Texture of a Stone or a ſtrange Fruit, we need only preſent it to the Tongue, the faithful Door-keeper, at leaſt before Sin, of all that ought to enter into the Houſe, to be aſſur'd whether it will make any diſturbance within. The ſame may be ſaid of all the other Organs of our Senſes. Nothing is quicker than the Touch, to inform us that we are burnt, when we touch a hot Iron without our Know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge. Thus the Soul leaving the Government of the Body to the Senſes, may apply it ſelf to the ſearch of the true Good, contemplate the Perfections and
<pb n="105" facs="tcp:97672:59"/>works of its Maker, ſtudy the Law of God, and govern all its motions by that. The Senſes ſhould only inform it with reſpect, and ceaſe to interrupt it, when it im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſes Silence on them. Thus it was once, but the Sin of our firſt Parent hath chang'd that admirable Order; and the union of the Soul and Body remaining ſtill the ſame, the Soul is reduc'd to a dependence on the Senſes, and is check'd and controul'd by them, becauſe, as I have often ſaid, it hath loſt the power to command them.</p>
               <p n="11">XI. The Senſes then were ordain'd to furniſh us with ſhort and certain ways to diſtinguiſh Bodies with reſpect to the preſervation of our Health and Life. Therefore we may make uſe of them to unite our ſelves by the Body to ſenſible Objects, or to ſeparate our ſelves from them; this is agreable to Order. I ſay, to unite or ſeparate our ſelves: Not to love or fear them. For Love and Hatred are Motions of the Soul which ſhould never be determin'd by confus'd Senſations; they ought to be guided by Reaſon, and not by Inſtinct. It is in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>different to the Body whether the Soul loves Bread or not. If we Eat it without loving it, the Body will nevertheleſs be nouriſh'd by it; and if we love it with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out eating it, the Body will be never the ſtronger; but the Soul will thereby be corrupted and diſorder'd. For every motion of the Soul, which inſtead of tending towards him who continually imprints this Motion on it, that it may love him alone, tends toward Bodies, dead, inferiour and impotent Subſtances; is blind, ir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>regular and ſenſual. Theſe are not abſtracted Chimeras, but neceſſary Truths, immutable Laws and indiſpenſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble Obligations.</p>
               <p n="12">XII. But what! Can we unite our ſelves to Bodies without loving them? Can we fly from our Enemy without fearing him? Yes without doubt we may: For I ſpeak principally of free and voluntary Motions, which certainly we may hinder from following the natural Motions. But ſuppoſing we could not: What then muſt we conclude from thence, but that the Heart of Man is ſo Corrupted, that his Diſeaſe is incurable, and that he cannot make uſe of his Senſes, without inflaming and renewing his Wounds; and conſequently that the mortification of the Senſes is the moſt neceſſary thing in
<pb n="106" facs="tcp:97672:60"/>the World in that condition to which Man is reduc'd? For after all, can it be doubted that God acts only for himſelf, that he imprints no motion on the Soul but for himſelf alone, that all love of corporeal Objects is Vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tious and Irregular, in a Word, that we are indiſpenſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly oblig'd to love God with all our Heart, with all our Soul and with all our Strength?</p>
               <p n="13">XIII. When the Soul is penetrated with the preſence of God, and beholds him Working continually in the Objects which ſtrike the Senſes; when the Mind is actually convinc'd of the impotence of the Creatures in general, and applies it ſelf to govern the Heart ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to the Light it hath receiv'd; without doubt it may at that inſtant unite it ſelf to Bodies, or ſeparate it ſelf from them, without loving or fearing them. Indeed this time of Reflection cannot laſt long. The Mind is ſoon tir'd with attention to its Duty; and when the Senſes come to be touc'h with any Object that pleaſes them, the Soul being ſtruck with the firſt appearance of Good and contented with it, conſtantly follows by its own Motion, that of the Humours and Blood. All Pleaſure excites and determines the natu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral motion of the Soul; and becauſe Man would al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ways be happy, the free motion of the Will readily conforms it ſelf to the natural Motion which is excited by the Senſes. We muſt reſiſt, if we would not follow that Motion: But we are ſoon tir'd with reſiſting, we loſe our beloved eaſe and become Miſerable, when we ceaſe to follow the attraction of Pleaſure, which makes us happy.</p>
               <p n="14">XIV. It is better to get out of a Stream which carries us away with it, if we ceaſe but one Moment to ſtrive againſt it, than to remain there in continual action; at leaſt this is the ſureſt way. It is better to break off, as far as we can, the correſpondence which we maintain by the Senſes with ſenſible Objects, than to expoſe our ſelves to innumerable Dangers, by relying on our own Strength which is vain and deceitful. The Imagination may magnify it, the Pride of Man may de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fend it; but Experience overthrows it, Faith condemns it, and makes it weak and deſpicable. At leaſt let us take the ſafeſt courſe: The thing in queſtion is Eternity, the dreadful alternative of the Felicity of the Saints,
<pb n="107" facs="tcp:97672:60"/>or the puniſhments of the Devils for infinite Ages. We may ſucceſsfully ſtop the Paſſages by which this dange<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous Correſpondence between the Senſes and falſe Goods is maintain'd. The motion of our Hands and Feet is ſubject to our Will. It is in our own Power to bend our Eyes downward, to turn our Head, and Fly. Thus we may avoid the Blow level'd at us by a murtherous Object. But if we ſtand to receive it, it wounds the Brain, it defiles the Imagination, it penetrates and cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rupts the Heart. Whatever effects the force of that Blow produces in the Brain, and in the Nerves which excite the Paſſions, they are in no wiſe ſubject to our Will. So that we may without much difficulty pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vent the Miſchief by the mortification of our Senſes, but we cannot cure it without infinite Conflicts. How happy ſhould we be, if we would learn ſo much Wiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom by coſtly Experience, as to hinder it from ſpreading, and throwing us headlong into Hell!</p>
               <p n="15">XV. Let us endeavour then to convince our ſelves throughly, that our Senſes are falſe Witneſſes, which conſtantly give their Teſtimony againſt us in fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour of our Paſſions: That if we are permitted to hearken to them for the good of the Body, nothing is more dangerous than to conſult them for the good of the Soul: That if it be very ridiculous to go to prove by Reaſon, that Gold, for inſtance, or precious Stones are not proper for Nouriſhment; it is alſo contrary to Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der and good Senſe, to examine by the Taſt, whether Wine be an Object worthy of our Love and Applica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion: That the motions of the Soul ſhould be govern'd by Light, and the motions and poſition of the Body by Pleaſure and Inſtinct: That Light never deceives, and that it leaves the Mind at liberty, without driving it forcibly toward the Good which it preſents, that ſo the Mind may love it with Freedom and Reaſon; that Pleaſure on the contrary is always deceitful, that it takes away or abridges the liberty of the Mind, and carries it naturally not toward God the true Author of that Pleaſure, but toward the ſenſible Object which ſeems to be the cauſe of it. Let us remember theſe Principles, and draw this conſequence from them, that the mor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tification of the Senſes is the moſt neceſſary exerciſe for him that deſigns to live by Reaſon to follow Order, to
<pb n="108" facs="tcp:97672:61"/>labour for Perfection, and to ſecure to himſelf a ſolid Happineſs, and an eternal Felicity.</p>
               <p n="16">XVI. Having prov'd at large in the firſt Book of the <hi>Search of Truth,</hi> that our Senſes generally ſpeaking deceive us in every thing, I think I need not inſiſt any longer on demonſtrating what I have here laid down. I rather fear that thoſe who have read and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſider'd my other Writings, will find Fault with me for repeating the ſame things over and over. But this Trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſe being deſign'd for all ſorts of People, it could not be avoided: For all theſe Truths have a connexion and relation to one another. We muſt know the Nature of Man and his Diſeaſes, at leaſt in ſome meaſure, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore we can comprehend the Remedies of them, and underſtand Morality by Principles. If I ſhould lay down as known all thoſe Truths which I have elſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>where prov'd, every Reader would not underſtand what I meant by them, many perhaps would be afraid of them as dangerous, and this Book would in all pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bability have the ſame Fate with the unfortunate <hi>Trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſe of Nature and Grace,</hi> which, tho' it were written only for thoſe who had a diſtinct conception of the Truths which I had before ſufficiently explain'd, as I then declar'd; underwent ſo furious a Cenſure, that thoſe very Hereſies were charg'd upon me, which I had there overthrown in their firſt Principles.</p>

Of that which the World calls Wit. That quality is very oppoſite to the Grace of Chriſt. It is fatal to thoſe who poſſeſs it, and to thoſe who eſteem and admire it in others, tho' they have it not themſelves.</hi>
               </head>
               <p n="1">I. THo' the Senſes are the firſt original of our Diſor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders, or the foundation of that union of the Soul and Body which now ſeparates the Soul from God; yet it is not ſufficient to regulate the uſe of them, that Grace may operate in us with its full Strength, but we muſt alſo ſilence our Imagination and Paſſions. The Imagination doth depend indeed on the Senſes, as well as the Paſſions; but it hath its particular Maligni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty. When it is ſtir'd up by the Senſes, it produces of it ſelf extraordinary effects: And many times tho' the Senſes do not actually move it, it acts by its own Strength. Nay ſometimes it diſturbs all the Ideas of the Soul by the Phantoms which it produces, and en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rages the Paſſions by the violence of the Motions which it excites. But for fear leſt ſome Perſons may not clear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly comprehend theſe Truths, I muſt give a more di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtinct explication of them.</p>
               <p n="2">II. This Term <hi>Imagination</hi> is very much us'd in the World: But yet I can hardly believe that all thoſe who pronounce the Word diſtinctly, joyn a diſtinct Idea to it. I have ſaid already, and ſay again, for there is no harm in reflecting on it more than once; that the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moneſt Words are the moſt confus'd, and that Men's ordinary Diſcourſe is many times nothing but an empty ſound of Words without Senſe, which they hear and repeat like Echo's. If a Converſation doth but entertain them agreably, and ſerves them to communicate their Affections, and to create a mutual eſteem of one ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, they are ſatisfied with it. They make the ſame uſe of Words as they do of a Man's Air and outward
<pb n="110" facs="tcp:97672:62"/>Behaviour. They unite themſelves to one another by the Senſes and Paſſions; and many times Reaſon hath no other ſhare in the Society, than to promote their unjuſt Deſigns. For Truth is of no uſe in this World. Thoſe that employ themſelves in the ſearch of it are Enthuſiaſts, ſingular and dangerous Perſons, who muſt be ſhun'd like an infectious Air. Thus Words, whoſe, chief uſe ſhould be to repreſent the pure Ideas of the Mind, generally ſerve only to expreſs Ideas of Senſe and thoſe motions of the Soul which are but too apt to communicate themſelves by the outward demeanour, the Air of the Face, the Tone of the Voice, and the Poſture and Motion of the Body.</p>
               <p n="3">III. <hi>Imagination</hi> is one of thoſe Terms which Uſe hath made current, without clearing the ſignification of it. For common Uſe explains only thoſe Words that excite, ſenſible Ideas. Thoſe by which it expreſſes pure and intellectual Ideas, are all of them either equivocal or confus'd. Thus the Imagination not being ſenſible but only by its Effects, and the nature of it being hard to underſtand, every one makes uſe of the ſame Word, without having the ſame Idea; nay perhaps many Peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple have no Idea of it at all.</p>
               <p n="4">IV. The Imagination may be conſider'd in a twofold reſpect, either as to the Body, or as to the Soul. In relation to the Body, it conſiſts of a Brain capable of Impreſſions, and of animal Spirits fit to make theſe Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſions. We may conceive the animal Spirits to be whatever we will Fancy them, provided we underſtand them to be Bodies, which by their motion are capable of acting in the ſubſtance of the principal part of the Brain. In relation to the Soul, the Imagination con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſts of Images that anſwer to the Impreſſions, and of At<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tention capable of forming theſe Images or ſenſible Ideas. For it is our Attention, which as the occaſional cauſe determines the courſe of the Spirits whereby the Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſions are form'd, to which Impreſſions the Ideas are annex'd: And all this in conſequence of the Laws of the union of the Soul and Body.</p>
               <p n="5">V. Theſe Images or Impreſſions which are form'd as well by the ſtrength of the Imagination, as by the action of Objects, diſpoſe the Brain, the Store-houſe of the Spirits, in ſuch a manner, that the courſe of
<pb n="111" facs="tcp:97672:62"/>theſe Spirits is determin'd toward certain Nerves, ſome of which run to the Heart and other <hi>Viſcera,</hi> and cauſe there Fermentation or Refrigeration, or in ſhort, pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duce different Motions according to the quality of the Object which is preſent to the Senſes, or the Imagina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion: The reſt of the Nerves anſwer to the external Parts, and by them the Body is plac'd in ſuch a Poſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, and diſpos'd to ſuch a motion as the preſent Ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject requires.</p>
               <p n="6">VI. The courſe of the animal Spirits toward thoſe Nerves which anſwer to the internal parts of the Body is accompanied with Paſſions on the part of the Soul: Which Paſſions ariſing originally from the action of the Imagination, do by the great abundance of Spirits which they ſend up to the Head, fortify the Impreſſion and Image of the Object which produc'd them. For the Paſſions excite, ſupport and ſtrengthen the Atten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, the occaſional cauſe of that courſe of the Spirits, whereby the Impreſſion of the Brain is form'd, which Impreſſion determines another courſe of the Spirits to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward the Heart and other parts of the Body, to keep up the ſame Paſſions; all this proceeds alſo from the admirable conſtitution of the Laws of the union of the Soul and Body. This is ſufficient to give a ſlight Idea of the Imagination, and of the relation it hath to the Paſſions. I have handled this matter more at large in another place. But this I think is ſufficient to make attentive Readers underſtand in ſome meaſure what I mean by Imagination in general.</p>
               <p n="7">VII. In particular by a <hi>defil'd</hi> and <hi>corrupt</hi> Imaginati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, I underſtand a Brain which hath receiv'd ſome Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſions ſo deep as to carry the Soul and thereby the Body, to Objects unworthy of and unbecoming the dignity of Man's Nature; and by <hi>purity</hi> of Imagination, I mean a ſound and entire Brain without any of thoſe vitious Impreſſions which corrupt the Mind and Heart.</p>
               <p>By a <hi>weak</hi> and <hi>tender</hi> Imagination, I mean a Brain whoſe principal part, on which the courſe of the Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rits depends, is eaſy to be penetrated and ſhaken.</p>
               <p>By a <hi>nice</hi> and <hi>curious</hi> Imagination, I underſtand a Brain whoſe Fibres are of ſo fine and curious a Texture, that they receive and preſerve the leaſt Impreſſions made between them by the courſe of the Spirits.</p>
               <pb n="112" facs="tcp:97672:63"/>
               <p>By a <hi>ſtrong</hi> and <hi>lively</hi> Imagination, I mean that the animal Spirits which form the Impreſſions are too much agitated in proportion to the conſiſtence of the Fibres of the Brain.</p>
               <p>By a <hi>large</hi> and <hi>ſpacious</hi> Imagination, I underſtand ſuch an abundance of Spirits as is able to keep wide open a great many Tracks or Impreſſions of the Brain at once.</p>
               <p>By a <hi>regular</hi> and <hi>well order'd</hi> Imagination, I mean a Brain whoſe principal part which ſhould obey the attention of the Mind hath none of its Fibres broken by the Paſſions or any other accident.</p>
               <p>By an <hi>Enthuſiaſt</hi> or <hi>viſionary,</hi> I mean one whoſe at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tention doth indeed determine the courſe of the Spirits, but cannot moderate their force, nor ſtop their motion. He thinks on what he pleaſes; but he ſees nothing as it is. For the Impreſſions being too large or too deep, no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing appears to him in its natural ſhape: Whatever he ſaith muſt always be taken with ſome allowance or de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duction. In this ſenſe every Man is an Enthuſiaſt in reſpect of ſome Things: Thoſe that know them beſt are the Wiſeſt.</p>
               <p>By a <hi>ſenſeleſs</hi> and <hi>ſtupid</hi> Man, I mean one whoſe At<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tention can neither ſtop nor determine the courſe of the Spirits.</p>
               <p>By a <hi>contagious</hi> and <hi>headſtrong</hi> Imagination, I under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtand ſuch an abundance of animal Spirits, and thoſe ſo agitated, that they diffuſe over all the Body, eſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cially the Face, an <hi>Air</hi> of Confidence which perſuades others. All Men when they are mov'd with any Paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion, and Enthuſiaſts at all times, have this kind of Ima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gination.</p>
               <p n="8">VIII. The ſubſtance and diſpoſition of the Fibres of the Brain being different in different Perſons, and in the ſame Perſons at different Ages, and the animal Spirits being more or leſs ſubtle, in greater or leſs quantity, more or leſs agitated; it may eaſily be judg'd that there are a great many more ſorts of Imaginations than thoſe I have here mention'd, and that we have not Terms enough to denote exactly the differences of them. For this word <hi>Imagination</hi> is a comprehenſive Term expreſſing not only many Ideas, but alſo an in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>finite number of Relations ariſing from the compariſon
<pb n="113" facs="tcp:97672:63"/>of theſe Ideas; which relations make the particular character of the ſeveral ſorts of Imaginations. The Brain of it ſelf in ſuch or ſuch a diſpoſition, conſider'd without the relation it hath to the motion, abundance or ſolidity of the Spirits, doth not make ſuch or ſuch a particular ſort of Imagination; but the relation which ariſes from the quality of the Spirits compar'd with the ſubſtance of the Fibres of the Brain. For a Man that hath a great abundance of Spirits very much agitated and very ſolid, hath not therefore a lively and ſpacious Imagination, if the Fibres of his Brain are too ſolid, too moiſt, too much interwoven one within another, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="9">IX. Theſe things being granted, I ſay that the Ima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gination produces as dangerous effects as the Senſes; and conſequently that it is neceſſary to keep it ſilent, if we deſire that Grace ſhould operate in us with all its efficacy.</p>
               <p n="10">X. For Firſt, the Imagination, as well as the Senſes, ſpeaks only for the good of the Body; for naturally whatſoever comes to the Soul by the Body, is only for the Body. This is a great and Fundamental Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciple.</p>
               <p n="11">XI. Secondly, the Imagination, when it is heated, continually interrupts the Soul: It often forces the Mind to anſwer and diſcourſe with it to the prejudice of Reaſon. Beſides, we may eaſily avoid the action of ſenſible Objects, and by that means make our Senſes ſilent: For it is in our own Power to ſhut our Eyes; or betake our ſelves to Flight. But we cannot eaſily diſpel the Phantoms rais'd by the Imagination; the Mind cannot avoid contemplating whatever paſſes in the Brain.</p>
               <p n="12">XII. Thirdly, the Senſes repreſent ſenſible Objects near enough to the Life: But the Imagination extends and enlarges them in ſuch a manner, that the Mind is ſometimes charm'd and ſometimes terrified with them. A Man whoſe Heart is corrupted by the irregular de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſires which the Imagination of its ſelf hath ſtir'd up in him, ſometimes finds him ſelf cur'd by the accompliſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of thoſe Deſires. The actual enjoyment of the Object of his diſorders, delivers him at leaſt for ſome time from a Paſſion which ow'd all its force and vehe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mence to the Imagination.</p>
               <pb n="114" facs="tcp:97672:64"/>
               <p n="13">XIII. Fourthly, the Senſes joyn us only to certain Objects that lie round about us, and are within their Sphere: But the Imagination makes the Mind a Slave to every thing. It unites it to the paſt, preſent and fu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, to Realities and Chimeras, to poſſible Beings, and to thoſe which neither God himſelf can create, nor the Mind comprehend. It forms dreadful Phantoms, and then is ſcar'd at them. It raiſes delightful Apparitions, and is pleaſed with them. It alters and deſtroys the nature of all Beings, and forms a Thouſand extrava<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gant Deſigns in a World of its own making, compos'd of Realities and Fictions.</p>
               <p n="14">XIV. Laſtly the Imagination, without going ſo far as downright Madneſs, diſturbs and diſſipates all the true Ideas, and corrupts the Heart by innumerable ways. It would be too long to ſet down the different effects of the ſeveral kinds of Imagination. But that which is moſt oppoſite to the efficacy of the Grace of Chriſt, is that which in the Language of the World is call'd <hi>Wit;</hi> for the better the Imagination is furniſh'd, the more dangerous it is; ſubtilty, delicacy, vivacity and ſpaciouſneſs of Imagination, great qualities in the Eyes of Men, are the moſt prolifick and the moſt general cauſes of the blindneſs of the Mind and the corruption of the Heart. What I here aſſert being a Paradox, I muſt not expect to be believ'd without Proof.</p>
               <p n="15">XV. The Soul is rational only by Reaſon: It is re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gular only by Order: It derives its perfection wholly from the immediate and direct union it hath with God. On the contrary, its union with the Body fills it with Darkneſs, and puts it in diſorder: Becauſe in our pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent Condition we cannot ſtrengthen this union without weaking that which is oppoſite to it. Now it is by the Imagination that the Soul dilates and ſpreads it ſelf over the Creatures; for it is united to Truth only by pure Ideas free from all imaginary and fantaſtical Ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pearances. So that the more ſtrength, vivacity and ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent the Imagination hath, the more the Mind employs it ſelf about ſenſible Objects; all this I have ſaid be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore. Now when the Imagination is beautiful, eaſy, clear and ſprightly, the Images which it forms are live<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, animated and delightful, always drawn to the Life and even beyond it. Thus he who by the ſtrength of
<pb n="115" facs="tcp:97672:64"/>his Imagination raiſes a great variety of different Ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects in his Mind, who makes his Phantoms always ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pear in a faſhionable Dreſs, and puts them into certain regular and harmonious Motions which give an agree<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able agitation to the whole Brain: He, I ſay, is charm'd with his own productions, and inſtead of contemplating things as they are in themſelves and as their Ideas repre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent them, delights continually in ſeeing his own Farces acted, and applauds the Fictions of his own Brain.</p>
               <p n="16">XVI. It is natural for all Men to ſeek Admirers, and the <hi>Man of Wit</hi> never fails of them. When he ſpeaks, as he ſpeaks well, all the World hearkens to him with Eſteem; as he ſpeaks agreably, they hear him with Pleaſure; as he advances only certain ſenſible Truths, which are really falſe ones (for that which is true to the Senſes, is falſe to the Mind) every one applauds him. Now is it poſſible for one who knows, or rather by the air and behaviour of his Auditors, is ſtrongly and ſenſibly perſuaded that they admire, love, honour and reſpect him, is it poſſible, I ſay, for ſuch an one to diſtruſt his own Thoughts, and believe that he is miſtaken? Can he avoid uniting himſelf not only to his own Viſions which enchant him, but alſo to that World which applauds him, to thoſe Friends which careſs him, and to thoſe Diſciples which adore him? Can he be cloſely united with God who hath ſo many ties and relations with the Creatures?</p>
               <p n="17">XVII. The <hi>Wit</hi> is a Man of Honour, I allow it: Yet he may be a Cheat, and there are as many of them of that Character, as any other. He is not Vicious, I grant it: Tho' there are Debauchees among them, and a great many too. But certainly the Man of Wit is ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny ways allied to the World: For how can he be Dead to the World, when the World is ſo much Alive to him? He is continually agitated by motions of Vanity: For every one that he converſes with doth nothing but pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>voke in him the Concupiſcence of Pride. The Man of Wit, I ſpeak ſtill of ſuch a one as lives in a ſelect and choſen World, one whoſe whole deſign is to gain an advantageous Poſt in Mens Minds, or by the Reputa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion he hath already gotten, is become in reality the Slave of all thoſe who look upon him as their Maſter: He, I ſay, is ſeparated from God at a greater diſtance
<pb n="116" facs="tcp:97672:65"/>than any other, and there is no likelyhood of his return. The delight of Grace may diffuſe it ſelf in his Heart ten times a Day; it will always find that Heart fill'd with Senſations and Motions that will choke it. The Light may illuminate his Mind, and diſpel its Phantoms; the Imagination will eaſily produce them again. There are too many Fetters to break, too many Chains to burſt, before this Captive can be deliver'd. But he is in love with his Chains, he is not ſenſible of his Slavery, or he glories in it.</p>
               <p n="18">XVIII. The Debauchee is not always actually in a Debauch; his Blood and Humours cannot hold out to maintain it; and when the Fermentation ceaſes, he is aſham'd of his Diſorders. But the Blood is always in a condition to furniſh Spirits enough to keep up the Luſt of Pride. What time then can be favourable for the efficacy of Grace? The Cheat feels continual checks of Conſcience which trouble and diſquiet him, but the Wit feels no remorſe. He will ſay, is it a Crime to have Wit, and to merit the eſteem of Perſons of Worth and Reputation? No, it is no Crime to have Wit, but it is an Error to take the Imagination for the Mind. It is not a Crime to merit the eſteem of others, but it is an illuſion to think that a Man merits it, I will not ſay, for having abundance of animal Spirits in his Head, or a juſt proportion of the Fibres of his Brain to the Spirits, but even for being united to Reaſon in the pureſt and cloſeſt manner that is poſſible. There is no Merit in the ſight of him who alone can judge of, and reward Merit, but by a conformity to Order, and a right uſe of Liberty: A uſe which cannot be well regulated without the aſſiſtance of Grace, and of which he who values himſelf upon it loſes the Merit, becauſe he doth not render to God alone the Glory which is due to him. Do we think that God hath created other Men to employ their Thoughts and beſtow their Love on us; to turn towards and admire us; to run after and rely upon us? Certainly God would be worſhip'd by his Creatures. But how! by proſtrating themſelves before his Altars, by burning Incenſe, by joining Voices with Inſtruments, and making the Churches reſound with harmonious Airs compos'd in his Praiſe? No, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out doubt God is a Spirit, and will be worſhip'd in
<pb n="117" facs="tcp:97672:65"/>Spirit and in Truth. He will have the whole Man, his Thoughts, Motions and Actions. But the Man of Wit, more than any one, attracts the Eyes of other Men, and fixes their Motions on himſelf. Inſtead of putting himſelf in a poſture of Adoration, and turning the Minds and Hearts of others towards him who alone ought to be worſhip'd, he exalts himſelf, and aſſumes an honourable Place in Mens Minds, he enters even in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to the Sanctuary of that Holy Temple, the principal Habitation of the living God, and by the ſenſible Pomp and Splendor which ſurrounds him, he proſtrates weak Imaginations at his Feet, and makes them pay him a true and ſpiritual Worſhip, a Worſhip which is due to God alone.</p>
               <p n="19">XIX. Now can he who ſeeks the eſteem of Men, and robs God of that which he moſt values in his Creatures, can he I ſay,
<note place="margin">1 Pet. 5.5.</note> draw down upon himſelf the favours of Heaven? Will God who reſiſts the Proud prevent him with his Bleſſings? The Spirit of God willingly reſts on ſuch as are humble, ſuch as the World deſpiſes, Theſe Truths the Scripture aſſures us of. He enlight<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ens thoſe that retire into themſelves: This Experience ſhews. But he blinds thoſe lively and ſparkling Ima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginations, which are always roving abroad: For Truth dwells within us. Beſides, the Grace either of Light or Senſe, doth not work its effect in the Mind and Heart of thoſe who are united to every thing that is about them: This is evident from what hath been here ſaid. So then the Man of Wit who ſeeks after Glory, ſhall find only a vain and tranſitory one, and ſhall fall for ever with thoſe proud and ambitious Spirits, into the diſgrace which he deſerves.</p>
               <p n="20">XX. But this beautiful ornament of Wit; ſo fatal to thoſe who poſſeſs it and value themſelves upon it, is alſo very dangerous to thoſe who eſteem and admire it in others without poſſeſſing it themſelves. This is a Truth neceſſary to be known. There is nothing more contagi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous than the Imagination; and thoſe in whom it is ſtrong and governing, are alway Maſters of thoſe that look intently on them. Their Air and Behaviour, do, as I may ſay, diffuſe conviction and certainty in all that behold them: For they act every thing with ſo much Paſſion and Life, that if a Man doth not retire into him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf,
<pb n="118" facs="tcp:97672:66"/>to confront that which they ſay with the anſwers of inward Truth, which is very hard to do in their Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſence; he is convinc'd, without knowing preciſely what it is he is convinc'd of; becauſe he is ſtruck, he is dazled, and ſubdu'd by force.</p>
               <p n="21">XXI. Nevertheleſs, we muſt know, that thoſe that have this lively and domineering Imagination, are of all Men the moſt ſubject to Error, their Sentiments are the moſt dangerous, and their Motions the moſt irregular. For the fuller the Brain is of Spirits, the more rebel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lious the Imagination is, the Paſſions are the more vio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent, the Body ſpeaks in a higher Tone, which never ſpeaks but in favour of the Body, to unite and ſubject the Soul to the Body, and to ſeparate it from him who alone is able to give it that perfection it is capable of. We ſhould therefore endeavour to ſilence our own Ima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gination, and be upon our guard againſt thoſe that pleaſe and excite it. We ſhould as much as is poſſible avoid the Converſation of the World. For when the Luſt either of Pride or Pleaſure, is actually provok'd, Grace cannot operate in us with its full efficacy.</p>
               <p n="22">XXII. Man is ſubject to Two ſorts of Concupi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcence, one of Pleaſure, and the other of Grandeur. This is a thing not ſufficiently taken notice of. When a Man enjoys ſenſual Pleaſures, his Imagination is polluted, and carnal Concupiſcence exerts and fortifies it ſelf. In like manner, when he goes abroad into the World, and ſeeks to advance himſelf in it, when he pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cures Friends, and gains Reputation, the Idea which he hath of himſelf ſtretches and grows larger in his Ima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gination, and the concupiſcence of Pride gains new and greater Strength. There are ſome impreſſions in the Brain naturally form'd for maintaining civil Society, and advancing a Man's private Fortune; as there are others relating to the preſervation of his Life, and the propagation of his Species. We are united to other Men by a thouſand Relations, as really as we are to our own Body: and every union with the Creatures diſunites us from God in the State we are now in, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe the impreſſions of the Brain are not ſubject to our Wills.</p>
               <p n="23">XXIII. All Men are well enough convinc'd of the pravity of carnal Concupiſcence, they have ſome fear
<pb n="119" facs="tcp:97672:66"/>and abhorrence of it, and in ſome meaſure avoid every thing that may provoke it. But there are very few that ſeriouſly reflect on the concupiſcence of Pride, or ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehend the danger of raiſing and augmenting it. Every one raſhly throws himſelf into the Converſation of the World, and embarks without fear on that tempeſtuous Sea, as S. <hi>Auguſtine</hi> calls it. We ſuffer our ſelves to be govern'd by the Spirit that reigns in the World, we aſpire to Greatneſs, and purſue Honour: For indeed how is it poſſible to remain unmov'd in the mid'ſt of that Torrent of People that ſurrounds us, who inſult and domineer over us, if they leave us behind them? In fine we get a Name, but it is ſuch a Name as makes a Man the more a Slave, the more Pains he hath taken to deſerve it; a Name which ſtraitly unites us to the Creatures, and ſeparates us from the Creator; a Name illuſtrious in the eſteem of Men, but a Name of Pride which God will deſtroy.</p>

               <head>CHAP. XIII. <hi>Of the Paſſions. What they are. Their dangerous effects. We muſt moderate them. The concluſion of the firſt Part.</hi>
               </head>
               <p n="1">I. THE Senſes, Imagination and Paſſions go always in company together: We cannot examine and condemn them apart. That which I have ſaid of the Senſes and Imagination, naturally reaches the Paſſions alſo. So that the Reader may eaſily judge what I am going to ſay, by what I have already ſaid: For I ſhall only explain a little more at large what I have been already oblig'd to ſay in part, by reaſon of the cloſe union that is between all the parts of our Being.</p>
               <p n="2">II. By the Paſſions I do not mean the Senſes, which produce them, nor the Imagination which excites and keeps them up: But I mean thoſe notions of the Soul and animal Spirits which are caus'd by the Senſes and Imagination, and act reciprocally on the cauſe which produc'd them: For all this is nothing but a continual
<pb n="120" facs="tcp:97672:67"/>circulation of Senſations and Motions which mutually produce and fortify one another. If the Senſes produce the Paſſions, the Paſſions in return, by the Motion which they excite in the Body, unite the Senſes to ſenſible Objects. If the Imagination ſtirs up the Paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions, the Paſſions, by a Counter-motion of the Spirits raiſe the Imagination; and each of them is reciprocally ſupported or produc'd anew by the effect of which it is the Cauſe; ſo admirable is the oeconomy of Man's Body and the mutual Relation of all the parts which compoſe it. But this matter deſerves a fuller Explication, in reſpect of the Conſequences which we ſhould draw from it.</p>
               <p n="3">III. The Paſſions are Motions of the Soul which ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>company that of the Spirits and the Blood, and pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duce in the Body, by the mechanical Frame and Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtitution of it, all the diſpoſitions neceſſary to ſupport and keep up the Cauſe from whence they ariſe. At the ſight of any Object which moves the Soul, (we will ſuppoſe that Object to be ſome Good) the animal Spirits which come from the Brain to the other parts of the Body, divide themſelves into two Branches or Courſes. One of theſe Courſes runs, or hath a tendency to run to the external parts, the Legs and Arms; or if they are unſerviceable, then to the Lungs and Organs of the Voice, in order to diſpoſe us and thoſe that are with us, to unite us to the Object. The other part of the Spirits goes into the Nerves belonging to the Heart, Lungs, Liver and other Viſcera, to proportion the Fer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mentation and Courſe of the Blood and Humours, to the quality of the preſent Good. By this means the Impreſſion which the preſence of any Good, or the Imagination forms in the Brain, and which determines the two Courſes of the Spirits, is preſerv'd and main<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain'd by new Spirits, with which the latter Courſe en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deavours to ſupply the Brain by the repeated and vio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent Shocks wherewith it ſhakes the Nerves that en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>compaſs the Veſſels containing the Humours and Blood, the Matter of which the Spirits are continually made.</p>
               <p n="4">IV. The Nerves which are diſtributed into the Limbs being full of Spirits, from their origine in the Brain, even to their extremities; and the Impreſſion of the Object forcibly driving the Spirits into all the
<pb n="121" facs="tcp:97672:67" rendition="simple:additions"/>parts of the Body, to give them a violent and extra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ordinary Motion, or put them into a forc'd Poſition, the Blood muſt of neceſſity aſcend up to the Head ſpeedily and in great abundance, by the Action of the Nerves which ſurround, and compreſs or dilate the Veſſels wherein it is contain'd. For if the Brain did not ſend a ſufficient quantity of Spirits into the Members of the Body, we could not long preſerve the Air, Poſture and Motion neceſſary for the acquiſition of Good and the avoidance of Evil. Nay, we ſhould fall into Swoun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings and Faintings; for this conſtantly happens when the Brain wants Spirits, and when the Communication which it hath by their means with the other parts of the Body is interrupted.</p>
               <p n="5">V. Thus the Body is an admirable Machine, com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pos'd of an infinite number of Pipes and Ciſterns, which have all innumerable communications with one another. The wonderful operation of this Machine de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pends wholly on the Courſe of the Spirits, which is differently determin'd by the elaſtick force of the ſeveral Springs, and the opening and ſhutting of the Paſſages by the Action of Objects on the Senſes, and the Motion of the principal part of the Brain; which Motion de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pends partly on the Will, and partly on the Courſe of the Spirits, excited by the Impreſſions of the Ima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gination and Memory.</p>
               <p n="6">VI. But that which I would have chiefly obſerv'd here, is, That the Courſe of the Spirits in the Nerves, belonging to the Viſcera, which drives the Blood up into the Head for the production of Spirits, neceſſary to diſpoſe the outward parts of the Body, with rela<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion to the preſent Object, acts with choice, and fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſhes the Brain only with ſuch Humours as are pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per for the preſervation of that Impreſſion by which the Paſſion is excited; or, which comes all to one, the Blood and Humours which aſcend up to the Head, divide themſelves in ſuch a manner, that ſo much of them as is fit for the production of Spirits, agreable to the prevailing Paſſion, remains there, and the reſt re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turns by the circulation, to the places from whence it came. Theſe Spirits being made, are preſently deter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>min'd toward the Impreſſion which is the original Cauſe of all theſe Motions, to preſerve it, and alſo to revive
<pb n="122" facs="tcp:97672:68"/>all the acceſſory Impreſſions which may any way for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tify and confirm it. From thoſe Impreſſions both the Principal one and the Acceſſories, the new Spirits do alſo receive their direction, and are divided, as the firſt were, into two Branches; one for the outward, and the other for the inward parts of the Body: For as long as the Paſſion laſts, this admirable Circulation of the Spirits and Blood is continually made, which ſets the Machine a going, according as the preſent Object requires, with a wonderful Regularity and Order.</p>
               <p n="7">VII. From hence it appears, that the Paſſions which are moſt wiſely ordain'd, with relation to their proper end; namely, the preſervation of Health and Life, the conjunction of Man and Woman, Society, Commerce, and the acquiſition of ſenſible Goods, are extremely oppoſite to the acquiſition of the true and ſpiritual Goods, the Goods due to Vertue and Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit.</p>
               <p n="8">VIII. For 1. The Paſſions are not ſubject to our Wills: Nothing is more difficult than to govern them, becauſe we have loſt that Power by Sin, which other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe we ſhould have had over our Bodies.</p>
               <p n="2">2. They are ſo contrary to Vertue and Merit, that a Man muſt ſacrifice and deſtroy them, if he would de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerve the Name and Reward of a truly vertuous Man, or a perfect Chriſtian.</p>
               <p n="3">3. Every Motion which they naturally excite in the Soul, is only for the good of the Body, according to this Maxim, <hi>That whatever happens to the Soul by the Body, is only for the Body.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="4">4. When they are rais'd, they take up the whole con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent of the Mind and Heart. The impreſſions and agi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation of the Brain, which they fortify by the Contri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>butions they draw from the Inteſtines, and ſend up ſpeedily and abundantly into the Head, diſturb all our Ideas; and the Shock and Motion they give the Will by that lively and agreeable Senſation which accompa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nies them, corrupts our Hearts, and throws us into in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>numerable diſorders.</p>
               <p>But 5. when their Agitation is ceas'd, yet the Imagi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation remains polluted by the Impreſſions which they have made on the Brain, whoſe Fibres have been bent or broken by the violence of the Spirits which they
<pb n="123" facs="tcp:97672:68"/>have put in Motion. Theſe Impreſſions often diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſipate the attention of the Mind, and generally revive the ſame Paſſions which produc'd them, when the Blood is impregnated again with Particles fit to raiſe ſuch a Fermentation as may produce abundance of Spirits agreeable to the nature of thoſe Paſſions.</p>
               <p n="6">6. The Paſſions by their rapid Courſe make a ſmooth and eaſy way for themſelves into the Nerves which go to the Heart and other inward parts of the Body, and there excite ſuch Motions as are proper to revive them again; ſo that the leaſt thing that ſhakes the Brain, is capable of renewing them.</p>
               <p n="7">7. Laſtly, all the Paſſions juſtify themſelves in ſuch a manner, that it is not poſſible at the time that they agi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tate the Mind, to make a ſolid and impartial Judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of the Objects which excite them; for ſuch is their malignant quality, that they are not ſatisfied if Reaſon too doth not give Judgment in favour of them.</p>
               <p n="9">IX. For I. They confirm the Judgment of the Sen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes, tho' they are ſo far from being competent Judges in the Eye of Reaſon, that they are falſe Witneſſes. II. They ſhew only the wrong ſide of Objects, and always repreſent them in that deceitful Shape which ſuits beſt with their Intereſt. III. They revive all thoſe Impreſſions and acceſſory Ideas which ſide with them, and ſuppreſs all the reſt. IV. They cover their irregu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar Proceedings and vitious Deſigns, with the ſpecious appearances of Reaſon, Juſtice and Vertue. The co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vetous Man, for inſtance, conceals from himſelf the Shamefulneſs, Injuſtice and Cruelty of his Avarice: He diſguiſes his Paſſion with notions of Temperance, Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deration, Prudence, Penance, or it may be of Charity, Liberality and Magnificence, by forming imaginary Deſigns which he will never put in execution; for the Paſſions are cunning enough to make even the Vertues oppoſite to them ſerve for their Juſtification. V. Laſtly, the Paſſions are always accompanied with a certain pleaſant Senſation, which bribes their Judge, and if he favours them, pays him to his content; whereas if he condemns them, they handle him very cruelly: For what Preſent can be offer'd more grateful and charm<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, to one that irreſiſtibly deſires to be happy, than Pleaſure, when it is actual Pleaſure that gives actual
<pb n="124" facs="tcp:97672:69" rendition="simple:additions"/>Happineſs? And what Treatment can be more rough, than that which the Soul receives from the Paſſions, when it would Sacrifice them to the Love of Order? We cannot ſtrike them without wounding our ſelves; for when they are upon their Guard, the blow which we aim at them, if it takes away their Life only for a little while, recoils back upon our ſelves and mortally Wounds us; or rather reduces us to ſuch a condition, as often ſeems worſe than Death it ſelf.</p>
               <p n="10">X. So then it is evident, that thoſe who are ſo far from moderating their Paſſions, that they do all they can to gratify them, who live by Humour, and act by Inclination, and judge of every thing by Fancy; in a word, thoſe who follow all the motions of the Machine, and ſuffer themſelves to be led, without know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing who it is that leads them, or whither they go; are continually departing from their true good, and by de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grees loſe ſight of it quite; they blot out the very Remembrance of it, and blindly run head-long into the Abyſs where all Evils dwell, and the eternal Pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation of all Good.</p>
               <p n="11">XI. It is true, indeed, that ſometimes Grace is ſtrong enough to ſtop in his full career one that aban<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dons himſelf to the motions of his Paſſions, and that God in goodneſs ſpeaks to the Soul in Thunder and Light<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning, and with a terrible Voice, which overthrows the Man and the Paſſion that hurries him away. But Chriſt very rarely beſtows ſuch Favours; and that Man is very ſenſeleſs, who throws himſelf into a Precipice, in expectation that God ſhould work a Miracle to ſave him from death.</p>
               <p n="12">XII. What then muſt we do to moderate our Paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions? I have already ſpoke of this in the Seventh Chapter and elſewhere; but I ſhall ſum it up here in few words. I. We ſhould avoid the Objects which excite them, and mortify our Senſes. II. We ſhould keep our Imagination within the bounds of that reſpect which it ows to Reaſon, or makes a continual revulſion in the animal Spirits, which by their Courſe keep up, and fortify the ſinful Impreſſions. III. We ſhould ſeek after the means to make our Paſſions appear ridiculous and contemptible, we ſhould examine them by the Light, confront them with Order, and uſe our utmoſt endea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vours
<pb n="125" facs="tcp:97672:69"/>to diſcover the foulneſs, injuſtice and irregula<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity of them, and their fatal conſequences, as well in reſpect of this life as the other. IV. We ſhould form no Deſign when they are excited, nor ever enter upon any Buſineſs by their direction or influence. V. We ſhould get a Habit, and lay an Obligation on our ſelves of conſulting Reaſon in every thing; and when<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever we have neglected to do it, either by ſurprize or for any other reaſon, we ſhould change our manner of proceeding, and at leaſt take upon us the ſhame we de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerve, for having acted like Brutes by the conſtruction and motion of the Machine; much leſs ſhould we ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtify the fooliſh ſtep we have made by continuing in a vitious and ſinful Courſe. VI. We ſhould labour to augment the ſtrength and liberty of our Mind, that we may be able to undergo the labour of Attention, and to ſuſpend our Aſſent till Evidence forces it from us. Without theſe two Qualifications, we cannot receive from Reaſon any certain Rules for the Government of our ſelves. VII. Laſtly; that we may be in a capacity to follow thoſe Rules which deſtroy the Paſſions, we ſhould, above all things, have recourſe to Prayer, and with confidence and humility draw near to him who came to deliver us by the ſtrength of his Grace, from that Body of Death, or that Law of the Fleſh which re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bels every moment againſt the Law of the Spirit. For I have often ſaid already, and do not ſtick to repeat it here again, becauſe I think there is no fear of reflecting on it too much, That neither Reaſon by it ſelf, nor all the helps which Philoſophy affords us, can without the influence of the ſecond <hi>Adam</hi> deliver us from the ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lignity of the firſt.</p>
               <p n="13">XIII. The ſum of what hath been ſaid relating to the Firſt Part of this Moral Eſſay, is this; Firſt I ſhew'd, that Vertue conſiſts preciſely in an habitual and ruling Love of the immutable Order. Then I ſpoke of the two principal Qualities neceſſary for the acqui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſition of Vertue. After that I laid open the occaſional Cauſes of Light and inward Senſe, without which we cannot acquire or preſerve the Love of Order. And laſtly, I examin'd into the occaſional Cauſes of certain Senſations which are contrary to thoſe of Grace, and a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bate the Force and Efficacy of them, that we may avoid
<pb n="126" facs="tcp:97672:70"/>them. So that, I think, I have omitted nothing neceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſary for the acquiſition and conſervation of Vertue in general. I come now to the Second Part, which treats not of Vertues, but of the Duties of Vertue: For I know of but one ſingle Vertue, which renders thoſe that poſſeſs it truly and ſubſtantially Vertuous; namely, an habitual and ruling Love of the immutable Order.</p>

               <head>CHAP. I. <hi>Good Men often do wicked Actions. The Love of Order muſt be enlightned to make it regular. Three Condi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions requir'd to make an Action perfectly Vertuous. We ſhould ſtudy the Duties of Man in general, and take ſome time every day to examine the Order and Circumſtances of them in particular.</hi>
               </head>
               <p n="1">I. THE Actions of thoſe that have attain'd to the true and ſolid Vertue, are not therefore all ſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lidly and ſubſtantially Vertuous. There is in a manner always ſome deficiency or imperfection in them; nay, many times they are really ſinful. The reaſon of this is, becauſe a Man doth not always Act by the influence of his predominant Habit, but ſometimes by the operation
<pb n="2" facs="tcp:97672:71"/>of the Paſſion, which is actually excited in him. For if the predominant Habit be aſleep, as I may ſay, and the reſt awake, the Actions of a good Man may be many ways ſinful: But beſides, tho' the predominant Habit of the Love of Order be actually excited in a good Man, yet at the ſame time his Actions may be defective and im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perfect, and even directly oppoſite to Order which he actually loves, and deſigns to follow. For, beſide the difficulty of paying an exact Obedience to the Order which we do know, indiſcreet and ill govern'd Zeal of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten makes us Act contrary to the Order which we do not know. Wherefore that an Action may be com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pleatly Vertuous, it is not ſufficient that it proceed from a good Man, nor from a Man actually mov'd by the Love of Order, but it muſt alſo be conformable to Order in all its Circumſtances; and that too not by a kind of Chance luckily determining the actual Motion of the Soul, but by the ſtrength of Reaſon, guiding and governing us in ſuch a manner as to make us ful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fill all our Duties.</p>
               <p n="2">II. So then, tho' it be ſufficient to make us juſt and acceptable to God, that the Love of Order be our pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dominant Habit; yet if we would be perfect and com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pleat, we muſt be able to govern this Love by an ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>act Knowledge of our Duties. Nay, I may ſay, that he who neglects or ſlights this Knowledge, what Zeal ſoever he may find within himſelf for Order, his Heart is by no means rightly diſpos'd. For Order would be lov'd by Reaſon, and not altogether by the Heart and fervency of Inſtinct, which often fills with indiſcreet Zeal thoſe whoſe Imagination is too brisk and lively; who are not us'd to retire into themſelves, but are continually apt to miſtake the ſecret inſpirations of their Paſſions, for the infallible Anſwers of the inward Truth.</p>
               <p n="3">III. Indeed, thoſe whoſe Mind is ſo weak, and their Paſſions ſo ſtrong, that they are not capable of giving Counſel to themſelves, or rather of taking Counſel of him who enlightens all Men, are excuſable before God; if they ſincerely deſire and follow the Advice of ſuch as they believe to be the beſt and wiſeſt Men. But thoſe who have or pretend to have Wit and Senſe, are guilty in the ſight of God, if they undertake any De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſign
<pb n="3" facs="tcp:97672:71"/>without conſulting him, that is, without conſulting Reaſon, how fervent ſoever the Zeal may be which tranſports them. For we muſt diſtinguiſh the Anſwers of the inward Truth which illuminates the Mind by the Evidence of its Light, from the Language and ſecret Inſpirations of the Paſſions, which confound and deceive it by ſuch Senſations as are indeed lively and agreeable, but always obſcure and confus'd.</p>
               <p n="4">IV. The Love of Order therefore requires of us three Conditions to make any of our Actions conforma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble to it: Firſt, That we examine the Action in it ſelf, and all its Circumſtances, as far as we are able. Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>condly, That we ſuſpend our Aſſent till Evidence forces it from us, or the Execution, till Neceſſity obliges us to defer it no longer. Thirdly, That we readily, ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>actly, and inviolably obey Order as far as it is known to us. Strength of Mind muſt make us couragiouſly undergo the labour of Attention: Liberty of Mind muſt moderate and wiſely govern the deſire of Aſſent: Submiſſion of Mind muſt make us follow the Light ſtep by ſtep, without ever going before it, or forſaking it; and the Love of Order muſt animate and quicken theſe three Faculties; by which, tho' it be hid in the bottom of our Heart, it diſcovers it ſelf to the Eyes of the World, and ſanctifies all our Actions in the ſight of God.</p>
               <p n="5">V. But ſince it is impoſſible for a Man that is not vers'd in the Science of Morality, to diſcover the Order of his Duties in ſudden and unexpected Occa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions, tho' he have never ſo great ſtrength and liberty of Mind; it is neceſſary for him to provide againſt thoſe Occaſions, which leave him no time for Examination, and by a prudent foreſight to inform himſelf of his Duties in general, or of ſome certain and undeniable Principles to govern his Actions by in particular Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes. This ſtudy of a Man's Duties, ought without doubt to be prefer'd before all others: Its End and Reward is Eternity. He that applies himſelf to Languages, to the Mathematicks, to Buſineſs, and neglects the ſtudy of the general Rules for the Government of his Life, is like a fooliſh Traveller, who loiters by the way or rambles out of it, and is overtaken by the Night, an eternal Night, which will deprive him for ever of the
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:97672:72"/>ſight of his Country, fill him with immortal deſpair, and leave him expos'd to the dreadful wrath of the Lamb, and the power of the Devils, or rather the ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtice of an avenging God.</p>
               <p n="6">VI. He that ſhould go about to examine in particular all the Duties belonging to the ſeveral conditions of Men, would undertake a Work which he could never finiſh, how indefatigable ſoever he were. For my part, I am too ſenſible of my own weakneſs to engage in ſo vaſt and difficult a Deſign; and all that I here pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tend to, is to ſet down in general, and that chiefly for my own private uſe, the Duties which all Men, as far as they are able, ought to pay to God, their Neigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bour and Themſelves. Every Man muſt examine his own particular Duties himſelf, as they relate to the general and eſſential Obligations, and according to Circumſtances which vary every moment: We ſhould ſet apart ſome time for this every day, and not ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pect to find in Books, nor it may be in other Men, ſo much Certainty and Light as we may in our ſelves, if we conſult the inward Truth ſincerely, faithfully and in the motion of the Love of Order.</p>

<pb n="5" facs="tcp:97672:72"/>ſwallowed up in the contemplation of his Eſſence, we ſhall be wholly penetrated with his Light and Plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure: But thither it is that we muſt tend; it is that which Faith gives us a Right to hope for; that to which it conducts us; that which it gives us an ear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſt of by the inward Reformation which the Grace of Chriſt works in us. For Faith leads us to the under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding of the Truth, and merits for us the Grace of Charity. Now Underſtanding and Charity, are the two eſſential ſtrokes which draw our Minds anew after our Original, who is call'd in the Scriptures Truth and Love. <hi>Beloved,</hi> ſaith St. <hi>John,
<note place="margin">1 John 3.2, 3.</note> now are we the Sons of God, and it doth not yet appear what we ſhall be; but we know that when he ſhall appear, we ſhall be like him, for we ſhall ſee him as he is. And every Man that hath this hope in him, purifieth himſelf, even as he is pure.
<note place="margin">Mat. 5.8.</note> Bleſſed are the pure in heart,</hi> ſaith Chriſt himſelf, <hi>for they ſhall ſee God.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="2">II. To diſcover the Duties which we owe to God, we muſt attentively conſider all his Attributes, and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſult our ſelves in reference to them: Eſpecially, we muſt examine his Power, Wiſdom and Love; and on our own part, our Judgments and Motions: For it is only by the Judgments and Motions of our Minds, that we render to God that which we owe him; as it is chief<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly on the account of his Power, Wiſdom and Love, that we indiſpenſably owe him the greateſt Duties.</p>
               <p n="3">III. When in thinking on God, we conſider him only as a Being of infinite Reality or Perfection, we are convinc'd that Order requires us to eſteem him infinitely. But we do not naturally conclude from this alone, that we ought to worſhip, fear or love him, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> The conſideration of God barely in himſelf, or with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out any relation to us, doth not excite thoſe Motions in the Soul which carry it towards Good, or the cauſe of its Happineſs, and produce in it fit diſpoſitions to receive the influence of that Good. There is nothing more evident, than that a Being infinitely perfect ought to be infinitely eſteem'd: No one can refuſe God this ſpeculative Duty; for it conſiſts only in a ſimple Judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, which no one can ſuſpend when the Evidence is full and convincing. And therefore wicked Men, thoſe that have no Religion, thoſe that deny the Providence
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:97672:73"/>of God, willingly pay him this Duty. But as they imagine that God doth not concern himſelf with our Affairs, that he is not the true and immediate Cauſe of every thing that is done here below, and that we can have no Communication, no Society, no Union with him, neither by a Reaſon, nor a Power in ſome ſort common both to him and us; they brutiſhly follow the agreeable Motions of their Paſſions, and pay thoſe Du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties to a blind Nature, which are due only to the Wiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom and Power of the Creatour.</p>
               <p n="4">IV. Theſe miſtaken Men argue and conclude right enough, but it is from falſe Principles; and you can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not eaſily make them underſtand that God requires any Duties of his Creatures, if you do not firſt rid them of a great many falſe Maxims; ſuch as theſe, for in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance. That if God concern'd himſelf with our Affairs, the World would not go as it doth; that Injuſtice would never be advanc'd to the Throne, and that Bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dies would not be rang'd ſo irregularly as they are; that ſo deform'd and miſhapen a World as this is, can be nothing but the work of a blind and unintelligent Nature, and that God doth not require of us vile Creatures, Honours unbecoming his Nature; that that which appears right and juſt to us, is not ſo in it ſelf or in the ſight of God, who if it were, would often Puniſh thoſe that he ought to Reward; for many times we meet with the greateſt Misfortunes, when we are doing the beſt Actions. I have elſewhere confuted theſe Principles; and if the Reader doth not clearly comprehend what I am going to ſay, he may read the firſt Eight of my <hi>Chriſtian Meditations.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="5">V. Wherefore that we may diſcover the Foundation and Original of our Duties, it is not ſufficient to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſider the infinitely perfect Being, without the relation it bears to us. On the contrary, we muſt above all things take notice, that we depend on the Power of God; that we are united to his Wiſdom, and that we have no Motion but from his Spirit, from the Love which he bears to himſelf. We depend on the Power of God; for we have our Exiſtence from that alone, we act by that alone, and can do nothing but by that. We are united to the Wiſdom of God; for by that alone we are enlightned, in that alone we diſcover
<pb n="7" facs="tcp:97672:73"/>Truth, we are rational only by that, for that alone is the univerſal Reaſon of all intelligent Beings. Laſtly, we have no Motion but from the Spirit of God; for as God acts only by his own Will, or by the Love which he bears to himſelf; ſo all the Love which we have for Good, is only an Effuſion or Impreſſion of that Love with which God loves himſelf. We love nothing invincibly and naturally but God, becauſe we love, and can love nothing but Good; and Good, I mean the cauſe of Happineſs, is no where but in God; for no Creature can of it ſelf Act on ſpiritual Subſtances. I muſt explain theſe things more at large, in order to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duce from them the Rules of our Conduct: I begin with Power, and the Duties we owe to it.</p>
               <p n="6">VI. Glory and Honour belong only to God:
<note place="margin">1 Tim. 1.17.</note> All the Motions of our Souls ought to tend toward him a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lone, for in him alone Power reſides. All the Wills of the Creatures are of themſelves impotent and ineffectual. He alone who gives them their Beings, can give them the Modes of their Beings; for the different Modes of Beings are nothing but the ſame Beings in ſuch and ſuch particular Faſhions or Diſpoſitions; nothing is more evident to one that can ſedately and ſilently conſult the inward Truth. For what can be plain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er, than that if God, for inſtance, will keep any Body always in one place, no Creature can remove it into another; and that Man cannot ſo much as move his Arm, but only becauſe God is pleaſs'd to do that which ungrateful and ſenſeleſs Man thinks he doth him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf? It is the ſame with the Modifications of ſpiritual Beings. If God creates or continues a Soul in the Modification of Pain, no other Spirit can deliver it from that Pain, nor make it feel Pleaſure, except God gives his Aſſent,

               <p n="7">VII. God hath ſubjected this preſent World to the Angels; it is they that act, and God that doth every thing. He hath given to Jeſus Chriſt as Head of the Church, a Sovereign Power over all the Nations of the Earth: Chriſt diſtributes the true Goods; but it
<pb n="8" facs="tcp:97672:74"/>is God alone who ſends them, it is he alone that acts in our Souls, and penetrates the hardneſs of our Hearts. Chriſt as he is Man, prays, intercedes, deſires and per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forms the Office of Advocate, Mediator and High-Prieſt. But it is God alone that operates, he only hath power, he is the ſole cauſe and beginning of all Things, and ought to be the ſole end. All the Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions of our Souls ſhould tend towards him, and to him alone belong Glory and Honour. This is that eternal, neceſſary and inviolable Law, which God hath eſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bliſh'd by the neceſſity of his own Being, by the love which he neceſſarily bears to himſelf; a Love which is always conformable to Order, and makes Order to be the inviolable Law of all ſpiritual Beings. When God ceaſes to know himſelf to be what he is, and to love himſelf as much as he deſerves, to act according to his own Light, and by the Motion of his own Love, when he ceaſes to obſerve this Law, then it will be lawful for us to deſire Glory our ſelves, or give it to any other beſide God; then we may without fear, delight in and make much of the Friendſhip of the Creatures; we may love and be belov'd, give and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive Worſhip and Adoration; we may then ſhew our ſelves to the World, to attract the Eſteem and Love of the World; we may exalt and expoſe our ſelves to View, as Objects fit to employ thoſe. Minds and Hearts which God hath made only for himſelf; we may then employ our ſelves either about our ſelves, or the imaginary Power of the Creatures.</p>
               <p n="8">VIII. There is nothing certainly more agreeable both to Chriſtianity and Reaſon, than this Principle, That it is God alone who doth every thing; and that he com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>municates his Power to the Creatures no otherwiſe than as he makes them <hi>Occaſional Cauſes</hi> for himſelf to act by, in ſuch a manner as bears the Character of an in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>finite Wiſdom, an immutable Nature, and an univerſal Cauſe; in ſuch a manner, that all the Glory which the work of the Creature deſerves, is refer'd to the Creator alone; when the Creatures by a Power which they have not in them, execute ſuch Deſigns as were form'd before their Creation. What is more holy than this Principle, which clearly ſhews to ſuch as are ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pable of rightly underſtanding it, that in many Caſes it
<pb n="9" facs="tcp:97672:74"/>is lawful for us to approach the Objects of our Senſes by the Motion of our Body; but that we muſt reſerve all the Motions of our Soul for God alone? For we may, nay and many times ought to move toward the occaſional Cauſe of our Senſations, but we muſt never leave it: We may join our ſelves to other Men; but we muſt never adore them with the Motion of our Love, either as our Good, or as capable of procuring us any Good: We muſt love and fear only the true Cauſe of Good and Evil: We muſt love and fear none but God in the Creatures.

<pb n="10" facs="tcp:97672:75"/>never had any joy but in thee, O Lord God of <hi>Abra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ham.</hi>
                  </q> What conſtancy of Mind! what greatneſs of Soul! This is it which the Law of God teaches us; and this alſo is demonſtrated by that Principle, that God alone doth every thing, and that the Creatures are only the <hi>Occaſional Cauſes</hi> of that Splendor which ſeems to environ them, and of thoſe Pleaſures which ſeem to flow from them. But the Duties we owe to Power, which is in none but God, require a more particular Explication.</p>
               <p n="10">X. All our Duties conſiſt properly in nothing but cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain Judgments and Motions of the Soul, as I ſaid be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore. <q>For God is a Spirit, and will be worſhip'd in Spirit and in Truth:</q> All our outward Actions are but Conſequences of the Action of our Mind. This clear <hi>Perception, That God alone hath Power,</hi> obliges us to form the following <hi>Judgments.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="1">1. That God alone is the Cauſe of our Being.</p>
               <p n="2">2. That he alone is the Cauſe of the duration of our Being, or of our Time.</p>
               <p n="3">3. That he alone is the Cauſe of our Knowledge.</p>
               <p n="4">4. That he alone is the Cauſe of the natural Motions of our Will.</p>
               <p n="5">5. That he alone is the Cauſe of our Senſations, Pleaſure, Pain, Hunger, Thirſt, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="6">6. That he alone is the Cauſe of all the Motions of our Body.</p>
               <p n="7">7. That neither Men, nor Angels, nor Devils, nor any other Creature, can of themſelves do us either good or harm: That they may nevertheleſs, as <hi>Occaſional Cauſes,</hi> determine God in conſequence of certain gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral Laws, to do us good or harm, by means of the Bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy to which we are united.</p>
               <p n="8">8. That in like manner we can do neither good nor harm to any one by our own ſtrength, but only oblige God by our practical Deſires, in conſequence of the Laws of the Union of the Soul and Body, to do good or harm to other Men: For we, indeed, have the Will to move our Tongue or Arm; but it is God alone who can and doth actually move them.</p>
               <p n="11">XI. Theſe Judgments require of us the following Motions.</p>
               <pb n="11" facs="tcp:97672:75"/>
               <p n="1">1. To love none but God with a <hi>Love of <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>nion</hi> or Conjunction, becauſe he alone is the Cauſe of our Happineſs, either ſmall or great, tranſitory or durable: I ſay with a <hi>Love of <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>nion;</hi> for we muſt love our Neighbour not as our Good, or the Cauſe of our Happineſs, but only as capable of enjoying the ſame Happineſs with us. The word <hi>Love</hi> is equivocal, and therefore we muſt take care of it.</p>
               <p n="2">2. To have no joy but in God alone; for he that rejoyces in any other thing, judges that that other thing can make him happy; which is a falſe Judgment, and can cauſe only an irregular Motion.</p>
               <p n="3">3. Never to unite our ſelves to the occaſional Cau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes of our Happineſs, contrary to the Prohibition of the true Cauſe; for that would be to oblige God in conſequence of his Laws, to promote Iniquity.</p>
               <p n="4">4. Not to unite our ſelves to them without a parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cular neceſſity; for the Sinner ought to avoid Pleaſure, becauſe actual Pleaſure gives actual Happineſs, and Happineſs is a Reward which the Sinner doth not de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerve; beſides, the Pleaſures which we enjoy by the means of the Body, fortify Concupiſcence, diſturb the Mind, and corrupt the Heart a thouſand ways. This is the Ground of the neceſſity of Penance.</p>
               <p n="5">5. To fear none but God, becauſe he alone can Pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſh us. We muſt fear God in this life, to keep us from offending him. The happy day will come, which ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cluding Sin, ſhall alſo baniſh Fear.</p>
               <p n="6">6. To be ſorry for nothing but our Sin, becauſe no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing but Sin can oblige a juſt God to make us miſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable. He that grieves at the loſs of a falſe Good, gives Honour to it, and conſiders it as a true Good. And he that grieves at a Misfortune which he cannot remedy, afflicts himſelf in vain. Self-love enlightned, is griev'd only for its own Diſorders, and Charity for thoſe of others.</p>
               <p n="7">7. Tho' God alone can make us miſerable, yet we muſt not hate him, tho' we may fear him. Only he that is harden'd in Sin, hates God out of Self-love; for being ſenſible that he will not obey God, or knowing, as the damn'd do, that in the condition which he likes and is pleas'd with, he hath no means of acceſs or re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turn to God, the invincible love of Happineſs inſpires
<pb n="12" facs="tcp:97672:76"/>him continually with an invincible hatred againſt him who alone can be the cauſe of Miſery.</p>
               <p n="8">8. We muſt not hate nor fear the occaſional cauſes of phyſical Evil or Miſery. We may ſeparate our ſelves from them. But we muſt not do that neither againſt the Will of the true Cauſe, I mean contrary to Order or the Law of God.</p>
               <p n="9">9. We ſhould <hi>will</hi> nothing but what God wills; becauſe we <hi>can</hi> do nothing but what God doth. If we have not the <hi>Power</hi> to act, it is plain that we ſhould not have the <hi>Will</hi> to act. Order or the divine Law ſhould alſo be our Law or the Rule of our Deſires and Actions; becauſe our Deſires are efficacious only by the power and action of God. I cannot move my Arm by my own <hi>Strength:</hi> And therefore I ought not to move it according to my own <hi>Deſires.</hi> The Law of God ſhould govern all the effects of <hi>Power,</hi> not only in God, but alſo in the Creatures. Order or the Law of God is common to all ſpiritual Beings: The Power of God is common to all Cauſes. Therefore we cannot diſpenſe with our Obedience to that Law, becauſe we cannot act but by the efficacy of that Power.</p>
               <p n="10">10. We may nevertheleſs deſire to be happy; nay we cannot deſire to be miſerable. But we muſt neither deſire nor do any thing to make us happy, but what Order allows of. We ſhall never find Happineſs, if we ſeek it by the <hi>Power</hi> of God contrary to his <hi>Law.</hi> It is an abuſe of Power to uſe it againſt the Will of him that communicates it. The voluptuous Man who deſires to be happy in this World, ſhall be ſo perhaps in part, in conſequence of the Laws of Nature: But he ſhall be eternally miſerable in the other, in conſequence of the immutable Order of Juſtice, or by the neceſſity of the divine Law, which requires that every abuſe of divine Things ſhould be eternally puniſh'd by the di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine Power. For we ſhould take good notice, that nothing is more holy, more ſacred, and more divine than Power: And he that attributes it to himſelf, he that makes it ſubſervient to his Pleaſures, his Pride, or his own particular Deſires, commits a Crime, the enor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mity of which God alone knows and can puniſh.</p>
               <pb n="13" facs="tcp:97672:76"/>
               <p n="11">11. It is an abominable piece of Injuſtice in any Man, to be proud of his Nobility, Dignity, Quality, Learn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, Riches or any other thing. <q>He that glorieth,
<note place="margin">2 Cor. 10.17.</note> let him glory in the Lord, and refer all things to him, for there is no Greatneſs nor Power but in God.</q> A Man may ſet ſome value on himſelf, and prefer him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf before his Horſe: He may and ought to eſteem other Men, and all the Creatures. God hath really im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parted to them his Being. But to ſpeak properly and exactly, he hath not imparted to them his Power and Glory. God doth every thing that we think we do our ſelves: He alone deſerves all the Honour which is given to his Creatures: He alone deſerves all the motions of our Souls. So that he who would be belov'd, honour'd and fear'd by other Men, would put himſelf in the place of the Almighty, and ſhare with him the Duties which belong to Power.</p>
               <p n="12">12. In like manner, he that fears, loves and honours the Creatures, as real Powers, commits a kind of Ido<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>latry; and his Crime becomes very hainous, when his fear or love runs to that exceſs, that they rule in his Heart above the fear and love of God. When he is leſs diſpos'd to employ himſelf about the Creator than about the Creatures, by a diſpoſition acquir'd by his own choice, or by free and voluntary Acts, he is an abomina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion in the ſight of God.</p>
               <p n="13">13. All the time that we loſe, or do not employ for God, who is the ſole cauſe of the duration of our Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, is a Robbery, or rather a kind of Sacrilege. For ſince God acts for his own Glory, and not for our Pleaſure, we do then, as much as in us lies, render his Action unſerviceable to his Deſigns.</p>
               <p n="14">14. In general, every Gift that God beſtows on us, which we render uſeleſs in relation to his Glory, is a Robbery; and God, by the neceſſity of his Law, will call us to an account for it.</p>
               <p n="15">15. Laſtly, the Power by which God Creates us and all our Faculties every Moment, gives him an un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>queſtionable Right over all that we are, and over all that belongs to us; which certainly belongs to us no otherwiſe, than that we may return it to God with all poſſible fidelity and thankfulneſs, and by the Gifts of God merit the poſſeſſion of God himſelf, through Jeſus
<pb n="14" facs="tcp:97672:77"/>Chriſt our Lord and Head, who takes us out of our prophane ſtate to ſanctify us, and make us fit to honour God, worthy to enter as his adopted Children, into the communion of good Things with the Father and the Son in the Unity of the Holy Spirit to all eternity.</p>

It is that alone which enlightens the Mind in conſequence of certain natural Laws, whoſe efficacy is determin'd by our Deſires as occaſional Cauſes.

               </head>
               <p n="1">I. HAving diſcover'd the principal Duties which we owe to the <hi>Power</hi> of God; we muſt next examine thoſe which we owe to his <hi>Wiſdom,</hi> which, tho' leſs known, are no leſs due. Every Creature depends eſſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tially on the Creator: Every ſpiritual Being is alſo eſſentially united to Reaſon. No Creature can act by its own Strength: And no ſpiritual Being can be illumi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nated by its own Light. For all our clear <hi>Ideas</hi> come from the univerſal <hi>Reaſon</hi> in which they are contain'd; as all our <hi>Strength</hi> proceeds wholly from the efficacy of the general cauſe, which alone hath <hi>Power.</hi> He that fancies himſelf to be his own <hi>Light</hi> and his own <hi>Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon,</hi> is no leſs deceiv'd, than he that thinks he really poſſeſſes <hi>Power:</hi> And he that gives thanks to his Bene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>factor for the Fruits of the Earth, which ſerve only to Feed the Body, is very ungrateful, very proud, or at leaſt very ſtupid, if he refuſe to acknowledge him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf indebted to God for the true and ſolid Goods, the knowledge of Truth, which is the Food of the Soul.</p>
               <p n="2">II. The Soul of Man hath two eſſential Relations. It is united to the univerſal Reaſon, and by that it hath, or may have a correſpondence with all intelligent Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings, even with God himſelf. It is united to a Body, and by that it hath, or may have a communication with all ſenſible Objects. The Power of God is the ſole efficacious Principle, or the bond of theſe two
<pb n="15" facs="tcp:97672:77"/>Unions: But impotent and ſtupid Man imagines that it is by the efficacy of his own Will, that he is Wiſe and Powerful, that he unites himſelf to the intellectual World, whoſe Relations he contemplates, and to the vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſible World, whoſe Beauties he admires.</p>
               <p n="3">III. It is God alone, who in conſequence of the Laws of the union of the Soul and Body, cauſes in Man all thoſe bodily Motions which carry him to, or remove him from ſenſible Objects. But the occaſional cauſe of theſe Motions being only the different deſires of his Will, he attributes to himſelf the Power of doing that which God alone operates in him; nay, the very endeavour which accompanies his Deſires, that painful endeavour, which is a certain mark of impotence and dependance, an endeavour often fruitleſs and ineffectu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>al, an endeavour which God puts into him to beat down his Pride, and make him deſerve his Gifts; this ſenſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble and confus'd endeavour, I ſay, perſuades him, that he hath Strength and Efficacy. He feels within himſelf a Will to move his Arm, but doth not ſee, nor feel the divine Operation in him; and therefore the more ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>act and punctual God is in anſwering his Deſires, the more diſingenuous Man is in not acknowledging the favour and goodneſs of God.</p>
               <p n="4">IV. In like manner, it is God alone, who, in conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quence of the natural Laws of the union of the Soul with Reaſon, diſcovers to Man all the Ideas which enlighten him, and leads him, as I may ſay, into the Country of Truth, the Habitation of the Soul, to ſhew him the Beauties and Wonders of it. But the occaſional cauſe of the preſence or abſence of Ideas being only the different deſires of our Will; we incon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiderately attribute to our ſelves the Power of doing that which proceeds from the ſole operation of God in us. And even the endeavour which accompanies our Attention, that painful endeavour, the certain Mark of impotence and dependance, an endeavour often fruit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſs, an endeavour which God excites in us to puniſh our Pride, and make us deſerve his Gifts; this ſenſible and confus'd endeavour, I ſay, perſuades us, like that which we make to move the parts of our Bodies, that we our ſelves are the Authors of that Knowledge which accompanies our Deſires. For having no perception
<pb n="16" facs="tcp:97672:78"/>at all of the operation of God, and having an inward Senſe of our own Attention; we look upon this Attention to be the true cauſe of thoſe effects which conſtantly and faithfully attend or follow it; for the ſame reaſon as we attribute to our own Wills the power of moving Bodies, and the ſenſible Qualities wherewith we are affected to the Objects which occaſion them.</p>
               <p n="5">V. He that by the motion of his Body approaches toward ſenſible Objects, or withdraws himſelf from them, feeling the Bodies which he meets with in that Motion ſtrike upon him, eaſily believes that he him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf is the cauſe of the removal of his own Body; but certainly he never thinks that he gives Being to thoſe Bodies that ſurround him. But he that by the appli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation of his Mind, leaves the Body as it were, and unites himſelf, wholly to Reaſon, imagines that the Truths he contemplates are of his own production: He fancies that he gives a Being to the Ideas he diſcovers, and that he forms, as I may ſay, out of his own Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance that intellectual World, in which he loſes him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf. Becauſe the things which he then beholds do not affect his Senſes, he imagines they have no real Exiſtence but in himſelf. For People judge of the reality of Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings, as they do of the ſolidity of Bodies, by the im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſion they make on their Senſes.</p>
               <p n="6">VI. It is certain that Man is not his own Wiſdom, and his own Light. There is an univerſal Reaſon which enlightens all ſpiritual Beings, an intellectual Subſtance common to all intelligent Natures, an im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mutable, neceſſary and eternal Subſtance. All ſpiritual Beings contemplate it, without diſturbing one another: They all poſſeſs it, without prejudicing one another: They all feed of it, without diminiſhing any thing of its abundance. It communicates it ſelf whole and en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tire to them all, and entire to every one of them. For all of them may as it were graſp the ſame Idea at the ſame time in different places, they may all poſſeſs it equally, they may all penetrate or be penetrated by it.</p>
               <p n="7">VII. But two. Men cannot eat the ſame Fruit, nor embrace the ſame Body, they cannot, at a diſtance from one another, hear the ſame Voice, nor many times ſee the ſame Objects. The Creatures are all particular
<pb n="17" facs="tcp:97672:78"/>Beings, and therefore cannot be one general and com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon Good. He that poſſeſſes theſe particular Goods, deprives others of them; and thereby provokes their hatred or envy againſt him. But Reaſon is a common Good, which unites thoſe that poſſeſs it in a perfect and durable Friendſhip. It is a Good that is not divi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded by poſſeſſion, it is not confin'd to ſpace, nor be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>comes the worſe for uſing. Truth is indiviſible,
<note place="margin">wiſd. 6.12.7.10.</note> infi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nite, eternal, immutable and incorruptible. <q>Wiſdom never fadeth away: The Light that cometh from her never goeth out.</q>
               </p>
               <p n="8">VIII. Now this general and immutable Wiſdom,
<note place="margin">Prov. 8.</note> this univerſal Reaſon, is the Wiſdom of God himſelf, by which and for which we are made. For God created us by his Power that he might unite us to his Wiſdom, and thereby give us the Honour of entring into an eternal Society with him, of conforming our Thoughts and deſires to his, and by that means of becoming like him, as far as a created Being is capable of it.
<note place="margin">Wiſd. 7.27, 28.</note> 
                  <q>Wiſdom remaining in her ſelf, maketh all things new, ſaith the wiſe Man, and in all Ages entring into holy Souls ſhe maketh them Friends of God and Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phets. For God loveth none but him that dwelleth with Wiſdom.</q> We have no way of acceſs to God, no Society with him, but by his Son, his Word, the univerſal and intellectual Reaſon, which was incarnate in the fulneſs of time, and made viſible to enlighten groſs and carnal Minds, and to lead them by the Senſes, by Faith and by a ſenſible Authority to Knowledge and Underſtanding: But ſtill it is Reaſon, ſtill Wiſdom, Light and Truth. For he that rejects the univerſal Reaſon, rejects the Author of Faith, who is that very Reaſon made ſenſible and proportion'd to the weakneſs of Men, who now hear only by their Senſes. With<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out doubt nothing is more agreeable to Reaſon, than that which Faith teaches us: The more we think on it, the more we are convinc'd, provided that Faith con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duct all the ſteps of the Mind, and the Imagination do not croſs it in its way, and by vain Chimeras or humane Thoughts diſpel the Light which Faith diffuſes in us.</p>
               <pb n="18" facs="tcp:97672:79"/>
               <p n="9">IX. Now to find out our Duties toward God, as he is Wiſdom or the univerſal Reaſon of intelligent Beings, it is not ſufficient to be throughly convinc'd of the union of the Soul with God, but we muſt alſo care<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully examine the Laws of the union of the Soul and Body: For we are ſo ſituated between God and Bodies, that as the union between the Soul and Body is aug<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mented and ſtrengthned, ſo the union of the Soul with God is weakened and diminiſh'd; and on the contrary, the leſs the Body acts on the Soul, the more the Soul is at liberty to conſult the inward Truth. I ſhall not here ſet down the particular Laws of the union of the Soul and Body; they may be learnt elſewhere. But we muſt remember in general, that our Senſes cauſe our Soul to extend it ſelf to our own Body, and make it attentive to the neceſſities thereof; and that our Ima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gination and Paſſions ſtretch to all thoſe that are about us: That the Body never ſpeaks to the Soul but for the Body, and that it inſolently draws us away from the Preſence of our inward Maſter, who never ſpeaks to us but for the good or perfection of our Being: In a Word, that our union with Reaſon is now ſo weak and tender, that the leaſt Senſation which ſtrikes us, breaks it intirely, tho' we endeavour never ſo much to retire into our ſelves, and to retain our Ideas which ſcatter and diſappear.</p>
               <p n="10">X. The Judgments which we ought to form in honour of the univerſal Reaſon are theſe.</p>
               <p n="1">1. There are not more Wiſdoms or more Reaſons than one.</p>
               <p n="2">2. No Man is Wiſdom and Light to himſelf or any other, nor one intelligent Being to another.</p>
               <p n="3">3. God by his <hi>Power</hi> is the <hi>cauſe</hi> of our clear Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceptions or Cognitions, in conſequence of our own De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſires or Attention: But the intellectual and common Subſtance of Truth alone is the Form, the Idea, and the immediate Object of them. The Soul ſeparated from <hi>Reaſon</hi> cannot attain to the knowledge of any Truth. It may by the action of God upon it, be ſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſible of its own Pain, Pleaſure, Perception, and all the other particular Modifications of which its ſubſtance is capable; but it cannot engroſs to it ſelf the knowledge of Truths which are common to all ſpiritual Beings.
<pb n="19" facs="tcp:97672:79"/>For Man who depends on the <hi>Power</hi> of God to be hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>py and powerful, muſt alſo be united to the <hi>Wiſdom</hi> of God to become Rational, Wiſe, Juſt and compleatly Perfect.</p>
               <p n="4">4. We do not derive from the Objects the Ideas which we have of them.</p>
               <p n="5">5. Men whom we call our <hi>Maſters</hi> are only <hi>Moni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tors.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="6">6. When we retire into our ſelves, it is not we that anſwer our ſelves, but the inward Maſter which dwells in us, which preſides immediately over all ſpiritual Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings, and gives them all the ſame anſwers.</p>

                  </note> All thoſe may be reduc'd to that general propo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſition of our Saviours, that we have but one Maſter, even Chriſt himſelf, who illuminates us by the evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence of his Light, when we retire into our ſelves; and ſolidly inſtructs us by Faith, when we conſult the viſible and infallible authority of the Church, in whoſe cuſtody the ſacred Treaſure of his written and unwritten Word is depoſited.</p>
               <p n="12">XII. From this great Principle the following Duties are deriv'd.</p>
               <p n="1">1. Not to value our ſelves on our Knowledge, but to return our humble Thanks for it to him who is the Fountain and Author of it.</p>
               <p n="2">2. To retire into our Selves as much as we can, and to hearken more readily to Reaſon than to Men.</p>
               <p n="3">3. To yield only to the Evidence of Reaſon, and the infallible Authority of the Church.</p>
               <p n="4">4. Whenever Men ſpeak, to be ſure to compare that which they ſay to our Ears, with that which Reaſon anſwers to our Mind; never to believe them but in what concerns Matters of Fact, and that too with a kind of ſaving and reſervation.</p>
               <p n="5">5. Never to ſpeak to them, at leaſt not with an air of Confidence, before Reaſon hath ſpoke to us by its Evidence.</p>
               <p n="6">6. To ſpeak to them always as <hi>Monitors,</hi> not as <hi>Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſters;</hi> to queſtion them often, and in different manners; and to lead them inſenſibly to our common Maſter, the univerſal Reaſon, by obliging them to retire into them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves. There is no way to inſtruct them but this.</p>
               <pb n="20" facs="tcp:97672:80"/>
               <p n="7">7. Never to diſpute for diſputing's ſake, nor even to propoſe Truth to others, when the Company they are in, Paſſion, or any other Reaſon give us ſufficiently to underſtand, that they will not retire into themſelves, to hear the deciſion of the impartial Judge.</p>
               <p n="8">8. Never to conſult Reaſon but about ſuch Matters as are ſuitable to the dignity of it, and uſeful to our ſelves, either to conduct us to Good, or unite us to Truth to regulate our Heart, or procure us Strength or liberty of Mind.</p>
               <p n="9">9. To lay up carefully in our Memory, as far as it is poſſible to be done, none but certain Principles and ſuch as abound in Conſequences; none but neceſſary Truths, or the precious anſwer of the inward Truth.</p>
               <p n="10">10. For the moſt part to neglect Matters of Fact, eſpecially thoſe that have no certain Rules to be judg'd by, ſuch as are the Actions of Men. They give no light to the Mind, and often corrupt the Heart.</p>
               <p n="11">11. Our inviolable Law is Order, not Cuſtom, which is many times oppoſite to Order and Reaſon. To follow Example without confronting it with Order, is to act like Brutes, and by Mechaniſm only. Nay it is better, tho' that be bad enough, to make our own Pleaſure our Law, than fooliſhly to obey pernicious and wicked Cuſtoms. Our Life and Actions ſhould do honour to our Reaſon, and be anſwerable to the illuſtrious Chara<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cters we bear.</p>
               <p n="12">12. We ſhould ſet no value on Subtilty, Beauty, or even Strength of Imagination, nor eſteem any of thoſe Studies which cultivate that part of us, which makes us ſo valuable and acceptable in the Eye of the World. An over-nice or over-ſtock'd Imagination doth not wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lingly ſubmit to Reaſon. It is always the Body which ſpeaks by the Imagination; and whenever the Body ſpeaks, it is an unhappy neceſſity that Reaſon muſt be ſilent or not regarded.</p>
               <p n="13">13. To confirm us in this diſ-eſteem, we ſhould fre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quently and with a particular Application examine by the inward. Light that which appears bright and ſpark<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling to the Imagination, that ſo we may diſſipate that falſe and bewitching Luſtre with which it hides its Fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lies. We ſhould very ſeldom regard Mens outward Behaviour which paſſes for current Payment in the World.</p>
               <pb n="21" facs="tcp:97672:80"/>
               <p n="14">14. We ſhould carefully ſtop up the Paſſages by which the Soul gets away from the preſence of God, and wan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders among the Creatures. A Mind continually diſtra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cted by the action of ſenſible Objects, cannot pay that reſpect and attendance which it owes to Reaſon. It is a Contempt to Reaſon to give our Senſes their full liberty.</p>
               <p n="15">15. We ſhould ardently love Truth, Wiſdom, or the univerſal Reaſon: We ſhould eſteem all the Gold of <hi>Peru</hi> but as a Grain of Sand in compariſon of it:

            <div n="4" type="chapter">
               <head>CHAP. IV. <hi>Of the Duties which we owe to the divine Love. Our Will is nothing but a continual impreſſion of the Love which God bears to himſelf, the only true Good. We cannot love Evil: But we may take that to be Evil, which is neither Good nor Evil. So we cannot hate Good: But the true Good is really the Evil of wicked Men, or the true cauſe of their Miſeries. That God may be Good in reſpect of us, our Love muſt be like his, or always ſubject to the divine Law, Motions or Duties.</hi>
               </head>
               <p n="1">I. WE depend on the power of God, and do no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing but by his Efficacy: We are united to his Wiſdom, and know nothing but by his Light: But this is not all; we are alſo animated and inſpir'd by his Love in ſuch a manner, that we are not capable of loving any Good, but by the continual impreſſion of the Love which he bears to himſelf. This is what I muſt now explain, in order to give a general view of our Duties toward God.</p>
               <p n="2">II. It is certain that God cannot act but for himſelf: He hath no other Motive but his Love of himſelf. He
<pb n="22" facs="tcp:97672:81"/>cannot Will but by his own Will; and his Will is not like ours, an impreſſion proceeding from, and tending toward ſomething elſe. As he is his own Good, his Love can be no other but Love of himſelf: His end is himſelf, and can be nothing but himſelf. Therefore he doth not produce in ſpiritual Beings a Love which hath a different tendency from his own, for the love of Good in ſpiritual Beings proceeds only from the Will of God, which is nothing elſe but the Love he bears to himſelf. But further, there are not Two or more true Goods; there is but one alone; for there is but one true Cauſe. Therefore there is nothing amiable, I mean with a love of Union, but God. So then, ſince God cannot will that we ſhould Love that which is not amiable, or not Love that which is amiable, ſuppoſing that we are capable of Loving, our Love proceeding from God, muſt neceſſarily according to the primitive inſtitution of its Nature, tend toward him, and be refer'd to him alone.</p>
               <p n="3">III. God having created our Souls with a deſign to make them happy, continually imprints on them a Love for Good; and as he acts only for himſelf, and Good neither is nor can be in any but in him, this natural Love of Good, doth of it ſelf carry them toward God alone. For this Love is like that which God bears to himſelf. It is alſo invincible and irreſiſtible; becauſe it is a powerful and continual Impreſſion of the divine Love; and it is the ſame thing with our Will; for it is only by the particular determinations of this Love, that we are capable of loving all Objects that have the appearance of Good.</p>
               <p n="4">IV. From hence it is plain, that we cannot love Evil, and that we have no Motion ordain'd for that end. Notwithſtanding we may miſtake Evil for Good; and ſo we may love Evil by loving Good; we may love Evil out of choice, by loving Good naturally; we may love Evil, or rather that which is neither Good nor Evil, by a horrid abuſe of that love for Good, which God continually imprints on us, to make us Love him, as being our only Good, or alone capable of making us happy. For we muſt take particular notice, that the Creatures, tho' they are all Perfect or Good in themſelves, are neither Good nor Evil in reſpect of us, becauſe they have not really the power to do us
<pb n="23" facs="tcp:97672:81"/>either Good or Harm. As they are occaſional cauſes of Good or Evil, of Pleaſure or Pain, we may unite our ſelves to them, or ſeparate our ſelves from them by the motion of our Body: But we cannot reaſonably Love or Fear them; becauſe every Motion which doth not tend toward God, the beginning and end of it, is irregular, and if it be free and voluntary, deſerves to be Puniſh'd.</p>
               <p n="5">V. It is alſo evident that we cannot hate Good; for ſince we invincibly deſire to be happy, we cannot ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parate our ſelves from that which makes us ſo; but we may miſtake Good for Evil, and ſo hate Good from the hatred we have for Evil. And even this hatred is at the bottom a motion of Love. We fly from Evil only by the motion of the Love we have for Good. For God having created us to be happy by loving him, hath given us no motion to ſeparate us from him, but only to unite us to him. The wicked or the damn'd hate God with an invincible and irreconcilable Hatred; but this proceeds from the very Love which God hath given them for himſelf. For ſince God is not their Good, but their Evil, or the cauſe of their Puniſhment, according to the <hi>Pſalmiſt,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Pſal. 18.26.</note> 
                  <q>With the Pure thou wilt ſhew thy ſelf Pure, and with the Froward thou wilt ſhew thy ſelf Froward;</q> they hate him by that irre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſtible Motion, which God, who is immutable in his proceeding, gives then for their Happineſs.</p>
               <p n="6">VI. For the right underſtanding of this, it is ſufficient to obſerve that actual Pleaſure is the formal cauſe of actual Happineſs, as Pain is of Miſery. Now the Damn'd feel Pain; the harden'd Sinner fears it. The Damn'd know that God alone is the cauſe of Pain, the Sinner believes he is. Therefore both of them, from the very deſire they have to be Happy, muſt of neceſſity make a wrong uſe of that Motion which God gives them to unite them to himſelf, and muſt ſeparate themſelves from him; for the more they are united to God, the more God acts on them, the more ſenſible they are of their Miſery. The Bleſſed on the contrary, for a like rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon, cannot ceaſe to love God. And thoſe that have acceſs to God, thoſe that expect to find their Happineſs in him, Sinners who by Faith in Chriſt have hope of returning and finding favour with God, may by the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vincible
<pb n="24" facs="tcp:97672:82"/>deſire of Happineſs, love and fear God. This is our condition in this Life.</p>
               <p n="7">VII. Now that the natural Love which God continu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally imprints on us, may ſtill continue Love, and not be turn'd into Hatred; that the love of Happineſs may make us Happy, that it may carry us toward God and unite us to him, inſtead of ſeparating us from him: In a word, that God may be or continue Good in reſpect of us, and not become Evil, our Love muſt always be conformable to or reſembling the divine Love; we muſt love Perfection as well as Happineſs; we muſt remain united to the wiſdom of God, as well as to his Power. For God when he created Man, gave him in the love of Good, and by the impreſſion of the Love which he bears to himſelf, as it were two ſorts of Love, one of Happineſs, and the other of Perfection. By the love of Happineſs he united him to his Power, which alone can make him Happy; and by the love of Perfection he united him to his Wiſdom, by which alone as his in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>violable Law he ought to be govern'd. God, if I may ſo ſay, is divinely inſpir'd with both theſe Loves: They are inſeparable in him; and they cannot be ſeparated in us, without deſtroying us utterly. For the power of God is Wiſe and Juſt: His Wiſdom is all Powerful; and he that thinks to retain the love of his Happineſs, without the love of his Perfection, without the love of Wiſdom, Juſtice, and the immutable Order; that love of Happineſs will only ſerve to make him eternally Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerable. God by his Power will not be the Good of Men, but their Evil, if by his Wiſdom he is not their Law, or the principle of their inward Reformation. For Happineſs is a Reward. It is not enough to deſire the enjoyment of it, but we muſt alſo deſerve it: And we cannot deſerve it, if we do not govern the motions of our Heart by the inviolable Law of all intelligent Beings, and regulate them according to the Model by which Man was firſt form'd, and by which he muſt be form'd anew. In a word, the love of Conformity, which relates to the immutable Order, or the Wiſdom of God, muſt always be joyn'd with the love of Union, which relates to his Power, that ſo our Love being like the divine Love, may carry us to all the Happineſs and all the Perfection that we are capable of.</p>
               <pb n="25" facs="tcp:97672:82"/>
               <p n="8">VIII. For we muſt obſerve, that in the condition we are now in, our Happineſs and our Perfection often claſh; and we cannot avoid engaging on one ſide or the other; either we muſt Sacrifice our Perfection to our Happineſs, or our Happineſs to our Perfection; the Love of Order to our Pleaſure, or our Pleaſure to the Love of Order. Now when we Sacrifice our Happineſs to our Perfection, or our Pleaſure to the Love of Order, we Merit; for then we obey the Divine Law, though we ſuffer by it, and thereby we give Honour to the Wiſdom of God, or the univerſal Reaſon; we leave that to God, which depends wholly on him, our Happineſs; and by that Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſſion, we give Honour to his Power. For Obedience to the Divine Law is partly in our own Power, but the enjoyment of Happineſs no way depends on us. Therefore we ſhould give up our Happineſs to the diſpoſal of God, and to apply our ſelves wholly to our Perfection, giving this honour alſo to God to believe him on his Word, to rely on his Juſtice and Goodneſs, and to live contented by Faith in the Strength of our Hope, according to thoſe words of the Scripture,
<note place="margin">Heb. 10.38. <hi>Juſtus <gap reason="illegible" resp="#UOM" extent="1 span">
                           <desc>〈…〉</desc>

                  </note> 
                  <q>The juſt ſhall live by Faith.</q> God is certainly juſt and faith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full; he will give us all the Happineſs we deſerve; our Patience ſhall not be Fruitleſs. But how great ſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever our Deſire be, and our Application in the Search of our Happineſs, yet this will not move God to give us the Enjoyment of it, without we deſerve it. This exceſſive Deſire will perhaps one day render us un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>worthy of it, according to thoſe admirable Words of our Saviour himſelf:
<note place="margin">Mat. 16 24.</note> 
                  <q>If any Man will come after me, let him deny himſelf and take up his Croſs, and follow me. For whoever will ſave his
<note n="†" place="margin">Soul. <gap reason="foreign">
                           <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                        </gap>.</note> life ſhall loſe it; and whoſoever will loſe his life, for my ſake ſhall find it. For what is a Man profited, if he ſhall gain the whole World, and loſe his own Soul? Or what ſhall a Man give in exchange for his Soul? For the Son of Man ſhall come in the Glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry of his Father, with his Angels; and then ſhall he reward every Man according to his Works.</q>
               </p>
               <p n="9">IX. Now this contrariety which we find at preſent between our Happineſs and our Perfection, proceeds from the Union of the Soul and Body, which is chang'd into a Dependance, as a Puniſhment of Sin. For the involuntary Motions of the Fibres of the principal
<pb n="26" facs="tcp:97672:83"/>part of the Brain, are the occaſional Cauſes of our plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſant or painful Senſations, and conſequently of our Hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pineſs or Miſery. The Body to which we are join'd, hath not the ſame Intereſts with Reaſon: It hath its particular Wants to be ſupplied; it makes its Demands with boldneſs and inſolence, and treats the Soul rough<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly if it refuſes to grant them. Whereas Reaſon uſes only Threatnings and Reproaches, which are not ſo live<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly and preſſing as actual Pleaſure and Pain: We muſt therefore bravely reſolve to be miſerable in this Life, that we may retain our Perfection and Integrity; we muſt Sacrifice our Body, or rather our actual Happi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, that we may remain inſeparably united to Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon, and obedient to the Divine Law; being content<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed with a foretaſte of the true Enjoyments, and having a firm hope, that that Divine Law, that Reaſon which was made Fleſh, ſacrificed and glorified in our Nature, or our Nature in that, will certainly reſtore to us all that we have loſt for our Obedience to it.</p>
               <p n="10">X. This clear perception, that our Will, or the na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tural and neceſſary Motion of our Love, is only a con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinual Impreſſion of the Love of God, who unites us to his Power, to make us conformable to his Wiſdom, or obedient to his Law, obliges us to form theſe Judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments.</p>
               <p n="1">1. That every Motion of Love which doth not tend toward God, is prejudicial, and leads to Evil, or makes the Cauſe of our Good to be the Cauſe of our Evil.</p>
               <p n="2">2. That every Motion of Love, not conformable to the immutable Order, which is the inviolable Law both of the Creatures and of the Creatour himſelf, is irregu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar; and ſince God is Juſt, that Motion obliges him to become our Evil, or the Cauſe of our Miſery.</p>
               <p n="3">3. That we cannot unite our ſelves to God, as our Good, if we do not conform our ſelves to him as our Law. The Converſe of this is alſo true; we cannot conform our ſelves to the Law of God, and by that conformity become Perfect; but we muſt alſo unite our ſelves to his Power, and by that Union be made Happy.</p>
               <p n="11">XI. This Truth may be alſo expreſs'd thus, accord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to the Analogy of Faith: We have no way of ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſs to God, no ſociety with him, no ſhare in his Hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pineſs,
<pb n="27" facs="tcp:97672:83"/>but by the univerſal Reaſon, the eternal Wiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom, the divine Word, who was made Fleſh, becauſe Man was become Carnal; by his Fleſh was made a Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crifice, becauſe Man was become a Sinner; and by the offering up of his Sacrifice was made a Mediatour, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe Man being corrupted, and no longer able to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſult or obey Reaſon purely intellectual, it could not be the Bond of the Society between God and Him. But yet we muſt take particular notice, That Reaſon by be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>coming incarnate, did not at all change its Nature, nor loſe any thing of its Power: It is immutable, and ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſarily exiſts; it is the only inviolable Law of ſpiri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tual Beings, and hath the ſole Right to command them. Faith is not contrary to Truth; it leads us to Truth, and by it eſtabliſhes ur Society with God for ever. We muſt conform our ſelves to the Word made Fleſh, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe the intellectual Word, the Word without Fleſh, is a Form too abſtracted, too ſublime and too pure to faſhion or new-mould groſs Spirits and corrupt Hearts; Spirits, that can take hold of nothing but what hath a Body, and are diſguſted at every thing that doth not touch and ſenſibly affect them.
<note place="margin">Every High Prieſt is or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dain'd to of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fer Gifts and Sacrifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces; where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore it is of neceſſity that the Man have ſomewhat alſo to offer, Heb. 8.3.</note> The Word was made a Sacrifice, becauſe without a Sacrifice, he had nothing to offer; he could not be a Prieſt, nor give Sinners any Communion with God, without an Atone<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment and an Oblation. We muſt be conformable to him in this Circumſtance alſo; for beſides, that it is we who are the Criminals, we are alſo a part of the Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crifice, which muſt be purified, conſecrated and offer'd up, before it can be glorified, and conſummated in God to all Eternity. But the life of Chriſt is our Pattern, only becauſe it was conformable to Order, our indiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>penſable Pattern, and our inviolable Law. We muſt follow Chriſt, even to the Croſs, becauſe Order re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quires that this Body of Sin ſhould be deſtroy'd for the Honour of Reaſon, and the Glory of him from whom it ſeparates us. Order requires, that by voluntary Pain, of which the Body is the occaſion, we ſhould deſerve the Happineſs of which God alone is the Cauſe, and which we have juſtly been depriv'd of, for thoſe un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>juſt and unreaſonable Pleaſures which we have unwor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thily and diſingenuouſly requir'd of a juſt God. Theſe
<pb n="28" facs="tcp:97672:84"/>are very trite and very common, but very neceſſary Truths.</p>

We ſhould love nothing but God, with a love of Union; and whenever we find any love for the Crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures, any joy in the Creatures ariſing in us, we ſhould ſtifle thoſe Senſations, and conſider that Power belongs to God alone, and that he inſpires us with his Love, to unite us only to himſelf.</p>
               <p n="2">2. We ſhould be afraid of Pleaſures, for they ſeduce and corrupt us. Pleaſure is the diſtinguiſhing Mark of Good; God alone can give us the enjoyment of it: But becauſe his Operation is not viſible, we look upon the Objects, which are only the occaſions of our Sen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſations, as if they were the Cauſes of them; and when we enjoy thoſe Objects, we love them as our Good, or at leaſt we love nothing but our ſelves, and our own Hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs. Now every Pleaſure which inclines us to the love of Bodies, Subſtances inferiour to our own Being, perverts and diſorders us; and ſince the Soul is not the Cauſe of its own Happineſs, it is blind, ingrateful, and unjuſt, if it loves its Pleaſure without rendring to the true Cauſe of it, the Love and Reſpect which are due to him: But beſides, how is it poſſible to love God in the midſt of Pleaſure? How can we actually encreaſe our Charity, when we ſo many ways provoke and for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tify our Concupiſcence?</p>
               <p n="3">3. The love of Grandeur, Elevation and Indepen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dance is abominable: He that deſires to be eſteem'd and lov'd, ought to be deteſted and abhor'd. What I ſhall thoſe Minds which were made to contemplate the univerſal Reaſon, and to love the Power of the true Good; ſhall they, I ſay, employ their Thoughts and their Love on us? Weak and Impotent as we are, ſhall we ſuffer our ſelves to be ador'd? Corrupt and Ignorant as we are, ſhall we ſeek Admirers, Imitators and Followers? Certainly, he that doth not ſee the In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>juſtice of Pride, hath no Communication with Reaſon; and he that knows it, and yet is not afraid of commit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting it, renounces Reaſon entirely.</p>
               <p n="4">4. We ſhould love Order; it is the Law of God, he inviolably obſerves it, he invincibly loves it. And can we think that we may ſafely diſpenſe with our Obe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dience
<pb n="29" facs="tcp:97672:84"/>to it? If we deviate from it, the inexorable Ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtice of the living God will follow us: But if our Love be conformable to that Law, we ſhall be happy and perfect both, we ſhall have fellowſhip with God, and a ſhare in his Happineſs and Glory.</p>
               <p n="5">5. We cannot be Rational but by the univerſal Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon; we cannot be Wiſe but by the eternal Wiſdom; we cannot be Juſt and Holy but by a conformity to the immutable Order: Let us therefore inceſſantly contem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plate Reaſon, let us ardently love Wiſdom, let us in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>violably obey the Divine Law: Let us faſhion our ſelves anew after our Model; he hath made himſelf like us, that he might make us like him: He is now le<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vel'd to our Capacity, he is proportion'd to our Weak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs: He is before us; let us open our Eyes to ſee him: He is within us; let us retire into our ſelves and conſult him: He ſollicites us continually; let us hear his Voice, and not hearden our Hearts.
<note place="margin">Heb. 5.</note> But he is alſo in the Holy of Holies, ordain'd a High Prieſt after the Order of <hi>Melchiſedech,</hi> always living to make interceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion for us, and to give us thoſe Succours which we extremely need. Let us therefore approach the true Mercy-Seat of Jeſus Chriſt the Saviour of Sinners, the Head of the Church, the Builder of the eternal Tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple; in a word, the occaſional Cauſe of Grace, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out which ſuch is our deprav'd and miſerable Condition, that we cannot endeavour our Amendment, we cannot eſteem and reliſh the true Goods, nor ſo much as deſire to be deliver'd from our Miſeries.</p>

               <head>CHAP. V. <hi>The three Divine Perſons imprint each their proper Cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racter on our Souls; and our Duties give equal Honour to them all three. Tho' our Duties conſiſt only in in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward Judgments and Motions, yet we muſt ſhew them by outward Signs, in regard of our Society with other Men.</hi>
               </head>
               <p n="1">I. THe three Divine Perſons of the Holy Trinity im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>print each their proper Character on the Spirits which they created after their own Image. The Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, whoſe peculiar Attribute is Power, imparts his Power to them, by making them occaſional Cauſes of all the Effects which are produc'd by them. The Son communicates his Wiſdom, and diſcovers to them all Truth by cloſely uniting them to that intellectual Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance which he hath, as he is the univerſal Reaſon. The Holy Ghoſt inſpires and ſanctifies them, by the invincible Impreſſion which they have for Good, and by Charity or the love of Order, which he ſheds abroad in their Hearts. As the Father begets his Word, ſo the Mind of Man, by his deſires, is the occaſional Cauſe of his Knowledge. And as the Father with the Son is the Fountain and Original of the Subſtantial and Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine Law; ſo our Knowledge occaſion'd by our deſires, which are the only Things that are truly in our Power, is with us the Principal and Original of all the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gular Motions of our Love.</p>
               <p n="2">II. It is true, the Father begets his Word of his own Subſtance; becauſe God alone is eſſentially and ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtantially his own Wiſdom and his own Light. The mutual Love of the Father and the Son, proceeds from themſelvees; becauſe God alone is his own Good, and his own Law. But we are not our own Reaſon, and therefore Light and Underſtanding cannot be a natural Emanation of our own Subſtance, We are not our own Good, nor our own Law; and therefore all the Motion we have muſt proceed from, and carry us to ſomething
<pb n="31" facs="tcp:97672:85"/>without us, it muſt unite us to our Good, and make us conformable to our Pattern.</p>
               <p n="3">III. God made all Things by his Wiſdom, and in the Motion of his Spirit or his Love: So alſo we never act but with Knowledge, and by the Motion of Love. The three Divine Perſons have an equal ſhare in the Production of all Things: So alſo that which we do without Knowledge, and without a full and entire Will, is not properly our own Work. The Father hath, as I may ſay, a Right of Miſſion over the Son: So it is in our power to think on what we will. The Son ſends the Holy Ghoſt, who proceeds from the Father and the Son, in the unity of the ſame Nature; ſo alſo our Love is grounded on Light, it proceeds from, and is produc'd by it. Laſtly, The Love which proceeds from a clear Perception or Knowledge, loves it ſelf, the Ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject of that Knowledge, and the Knowledge it ſelf; as the ſubſtantial Love infinitely loves the Divine Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance in the Father begetting, in the Son begotten, and in the Holy Ghoſt himſelf, proceeding from the Father and the Son.</p>
               <p n="4">IV. All theſe Relations of the Mind of Man to the holy Trinity, are but ſhadows and imperfect Draughts, which can never come up to the Original of all Beings, who by an incomprehenſible property of Infinity, com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>municates himſelf without Diviſion, and forms a Socie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty of three different Perſons in the unity of the ſame Subſtance. But tho' the Image of God which we bear, be very imperfect in reſpect of our Original; yet there is nothing more great and noble for a mere created Being, than this faint reſemblance. We labour for our Perfection, only as we maintain and keep it up; we ſecure our Happineſs no further, than we faſhion our ſelves according to our Model. All our true Judgments and regular Motions, all the Duties which we pay to the Wiſdom, Power and Love of God, are ſo as many Steps by which we advance toward the Fountain of all Good; and an habitual Diſpoſition to frame theſe Judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments and excite theſe Motions, is the real Perfection of Man, who eſſentially depends on the ſupreme Good, and was made for no other End, but to find his Perfe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction and Happineſs in doing his Duty.</p>
               <pb n="32" facs="tcp:97672:86"/>
               <p n="5">V. Now as the three Perſons in the Trinity are but one God, one and the ſame Subſtance; ſo all thoſe Du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties which ſeem to relate particularly to any one of the Perſons, give equal Honour to the other two. Every Regular Motion honours the Power of the Father, as its Good; the Wiſdom of the Son, as its Law; and the mutual Love of the Father and the Son, as its Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cipal and Original. On the contrary, every Sin, or every Love of the Creatures diſhonours the true Power, oppoſes the univerſal Reaſon, and reſiſts the holy Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit: So that we cannot abſolutely ſeparate the Duties which we owe to the Power of God, from thoſe which we owe to his Wiſdom and to the Subſtantial and Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine Love; and therefore I have been forc'd, in the three foregoing Chapters, to repeat the ſame things after different manners.</p>
               <p n="6">VI. Tho' all the Duties which Spiritual Beings owe to God, who is a pure Spirit, and will be worſhip'd in Spirit and in Truth, conſiſt only in true Judgments, and Motions of Love conformable to thoſe Judgments; yet Men being compos'd of a Soul and a Body, living in Societies with one another, educated in the ſame outward Religious Worſhip, and thereby tied to cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain Ceremonies; they are oblig'd to an infinite num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber of particular Duties, which have all of them a ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſary Relation to thoſe which I have already ſet down in general. All theſe external Duties are arbitra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry and indifferent, at leaſt in their firſt Foundation and Original; but the ſpiritual Duties are in themſelves ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolutely neceſſary. We may diſpenſe with outward Duties, but we can never diſpenſe with the others; they depend on an inviolable Law, the immutable and neceſſary Order. Outward Duties of themſelves do not ſanctify thoſe that render them to God; they re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive their Worth and Value only from the ſpiritual Duties which accompany them; but all the Motions of the Soul which are govern'd by true Judgments, do immediately and of themſelves, honour the Divine Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fections.</p>
               <p n="7">VII. Thus, for inſtance, it is a Duty indifferent in it ſelf, for a Man to pull off his Hat when he comes into a Church. But to enter into the preſence of God with reſpect, and with ſome inward Motion of Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion,
<pb n="33" facs="tcp:97672:86"/>is not an arbitrary, but an eſſential Duty. He that for ſome particular Reaſon cannot be uncover'd at Maſs, may be cover'd at the Celebration of it; Wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men are excus'd from this Duty; and provided it be known that it is not done out of contempt, but upon neceſſity, commonly their needs no diſpenſation for it. None but thoſe that have wrong Notions of things, cen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forious and weak People will find fault with it; but no one that is preſent at that Sacrifice can be excus'd from offering up to God the Sacrifice of his Mind and Heart, Praiſes and Motions which honour God. He that proſtrates himſelf before the Altar, is ſo far from meriting, and honouring God by that outward Duty, that he commits a heinous Crime, if he deſigns by that Action only to gain the Eſteem of the World. But he, who tho' he be unmov'd outwardly, is nevertheleſs inwardly agitated with Motions agreeable to the Know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge which Faith and Reaſon give him of the Divine Attributes, honours God, draws near and unites him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf to him. He conforms himſelf to the immutable Law by Regular Motions, which leave behind them a Habit or Diſpoſition of Charity, and thereby truly pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rifies and ſanctifies himſelf. But there are many People whoſe Religion is not ſpiritual; they go no farther than the outſide which makes an Impreſſion on them, and often determines them to do that by imitation, which they had no deſign to do of themſelves.</p>
               <p n="8">VIII. Certainly it is a diſreſpect to the univer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſal Reaſon, to ſeparate our ſelves from it by the uſe of Wine; or to run away from our ſelves, where Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon inhabits, and where it gives its Oracles, and ſuffer our ſelves to be carried by our Paſſions into a World where the Imagination reigns. In a word, to depart voluntarily, and without any neceſſity, from the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſence of our Good and of our Reaſon, is a Motion which diſhonours the Divine Majeſty, it is Irreligious and Impious. But the generality of People do not judge of things after this manner; they judge of a Man's inward Sentiments by his outward Actions and Behaviour; they imagine it a great Crime to do ſome Actions in a holy Place, tho' perhaps they are not in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>decent in themſelves; and yet never conſider, that no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing is more indecent than to neglect the eſſential Du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties
<pb n="34" facs="tcp:97672:87"/>of a rational Creature in any place whatſoever. A Man that is Religious even to Superſtition paſſes for a Saint with them, but the Chriſtian Philoſopher is counted no better than a Heathen, if he will not aban<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>don Reaſon to agree with their Notions, and religi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſly obſerve their Cuſtoms.</p>
               <p n="9">IX. Indeed the Philoſopher doth ill, if he neglects the external Duties,
<note place="margin">Mat. 18.6.</note> and thereby offends the Weak and Simple. <q>It were better for him that a Mill-ſtone were hang'd about his Neck, and that he were Drown'd in the depth of the Sea.</q> Every Man ought to teſtify his Faith by viſible Actions, and thereby incline other Men, who are always affected with the outward Beha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>haviour, to ſuch Motions as give honour to God. In every thing that relates to God, we ſhould with all Humility aſſume the air and poſture of Adoration. Any other is at leaſt Fooliſh and Ridiculous. But it is Impi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous, to uſe ſuch outward Actions as are ſuperſtitious and lead Men's Minds to Judgments and Motions which diſho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour the divine Attributes. They are excuſable perhaps in ſuch as have but a confus'd Idea of God: But he that is better inſtructed in Religion, and hath a more particular knowledge of the divine Perfections, ought not to do any thing out of any humane Conſideration, that contra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dicts his own Light.</p>
               <p n="10">X. The greateſt part of Chriſtians have a Jewiſh Spirit;
<note place="margin">Joh. 17.3.</note> their Religion is not Spiritual, and conſequently not Rational. <q>This is Life eternal, to know the true God, and Jeſus Chriſt his only Son:</q> To have Senti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments worthy of the divine Attributes, and Motions agreable to thoſe Sentiments: To know Jeſus Chriſt, who alone gives us acceſs to the Father, and diffuſes Charity in our Hearts: To be fully convinc'd, that he alone is the High-Prieſt of the true Goods, or the oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caſional cauſe of Grace, that ſo we may draw near to him with Confidence, and by his aſſiſtance excite in our ſelves ſuch Motions as are ſuitable to the knowledge he hath given us of the true Worſhip, which honours the divine Majeſty. But inſtead of this, every one frames to himſelf a Theology, a Religion, or at leaſt a Devotion apart, of which Self-love is the Motive, Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>judice and Poſſeſſion the Foundation and Beginning, and ſenſual Goods the End. The Worſhip of God con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſts many times only in outward Sacrifices, in verbal
<pb n="35" facs="tcp:97672:87"/>Prayers, in Ceremonies which were at firſt ordain'd to raiſe the Mind to God, but now ſerve only by their ſplendor and magnificence to refreſh the Imagination in moſt People, when they are tir'd and out of reliſh with the performance of their Duties to God. Cuſtom, hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man Conſiderations, or Hypocriſy carry their Bodies into the Church: But their Minds and Hearts never come there. And while the Prieſt offers up Jeſus Chriſt to God in their Preſence, or rather while Chriſt offers up himſelf to his Father for their Sins on our Altars, they on their part Sacrifice to Ambition, Avarice or Pleaſure, ſpiritual Sacrifices in all the places whither their Imagination carries them.</p>

               </head>
               <p n="1">I. HAVING explain'd in general the Duties which we owe to God, we muſt now examine thoſe which we owe to other Men, as God hath made us to live in Society with them under the ſame Law, the univerſal Reaſon, and in a dependance on the ſame Pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er, that of the King of Kings, and ſupreme Lord of all things.</p>
               <p n="2">II. We are capable of forming Two ſorts of Society with other Men: A Society for ſome Years, and an eternal Society: A Society of Commerce, and a So<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciety of Religion: A Society maintain'd by the Paſſions, and ſubſiſting in a communion of particular and periſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Goods, whoſe end is the preſervation and welfare of the Body; and a Society govern'd by Reaſon, ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ported by Faith, and ſubſiſting in the communion of the true Goods, whoſe end is a happy Life to all eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity.</p>
               <pb n="36" facs="tcp:97672:88"/>
               <p n="3">III. The great, or indeed the only deſign of God, is the holy City, the heavenly <hi>Jeruſalem,</hi> where Truth and Juſtice inhabit. All other Societies ſhall Periſh, tho' God be immutable in his Deſigns: But this ſpiri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tual Society ſhall continue for ever. The Kingdom of Chriſt ſhall have no end: His Temple ſhall be eternal: His Prieſt-hood ſhall never the chang'd:
<note place="margin">Pſal. 110.3.</note> 
                  <q>The Lord hath Sworn, and will not Repent, Thou art a Prieſt for ever, after the order of <hi>Melchiſedeck.</hi>
                  </q> The Houſe of God is built on an unſhaken Foundation, on that belov'd Son in whom God is well-pleas'd, and by whom all things ſhall ſubſiſt to the Glory of him who gives them their Being.</p>
               <p n="4">IV. When we procure any ſettlement here below for our ſelves or our Friends, we build on the Sand, we place our Friends in a tottering Houſe, it will ſink under us, at the Hour of Death to be ſure. But when we enter our ſelves as Workmen in the building of the Temple of the true <hi>Solomon,</hi> and cauſe others to come in, we then labour for Eternity. This Work ſhall laſt to all Ages. This then is the good which we ought to procure for our ſelves, and other Men: This is the chief end of all our Duties toward them: This is that holy Society which we muſt begin here below, by the love which we owe to one another. For ſince the deſign of God in theſe temporary and periſhing So<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cieties, is only to furniſh Chriſt, the Architect of the eternal Temple, with fit Materials for the building of his Church; we cannot fail of performing eſſential Duties, when we engage in the deſigns of him who would have all Men to be ſav'd, and employ all our Faculties in haſtning his great Work, and in procuring to Men thoſe good things for which they were created.</p>
               <p n="5">V. So when our Saviour bids us Love one another, we muſt not imagine that he abſolutely commands us any other thing, than to procure one another the true and ſpiritual Goods. What kind of Bleſſings were thoſe which he ſhowr'd on his Apoſtles and Diſciples? Did he give them the fading and periſhing Goods, ſuch as the pretended Friends of this World give to thoſe that gratify their Paſſions? Did he conſtantly deliver them out of the Hands of their Perſecutors? No certainly-Therefore the principal Duties of our Charity do not
<pb n="37" facs="tcp:97672:88"/>conſiſt in ſuch things as theſe. We muſt aſſiſt our Neighbour, and preſerve his Life, as we are oblig'd to preſerve our own, but we muſt prefer the Salvation of our Neighbour before his and our own Life.</p>
               <p n="6">VI. <hi>To Love</hi> therefore is an equivocal Term. It ſig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifies Three very different things, which we muſt care<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully diſtinguiſh: To unite our ſelves by our Will to an Object, as our Good, or the cauſe of our Happi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs: To conform our ſelves to any thing as our pat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tern, or the rule of our Perfection: And to wiſh well to any Perſon, or to deſire that he may be happy and perfect. The love of Union is due only to the power of God: The love of Conformity is due only to the law of God, the immutable Order. No Creature is capable of acting on us: No Perſon can be our living Law, or our perfect Model. Chriſt himſelf, tho' he was without Sin, tho' he was Reaſon incarnate, did ſome things which we muſt not do, becauſe the cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumſtances not being the ſame, the intellectual Reaſon, the inviolable Law, the indiſpenſable Model of all in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>telligent Beings forbids us to do them.</p>
               <p n="7">VII. So then we muſt not love our Neighbour with a love of Union, nor with a love of Conformity. But we may and ought to Love him with a love of Benevo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lence. We muſt Love him in that ſenſe of the Word which ſignifies to deſire his Happineſs and Perfection; and as our practical deſires are the occaſional cauſes of certain effects which conduce to that end, we muſt uſe all our endeavours to procure him ſolid Vertue, that he may merit the true Goods which are the reward of it. This is the obligation that truly and abſolutely lies upon us from that Commandment which our Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viour hath given us in the Goſpel, to Love one another as ourſelves, and as he hath loved us.</p>
               <p n="8">VIII. <hi>To Honour</hi> is alſo an equivocal Word: It de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>notes a ſubmiſſion of the Mind to the true Power, a reſpect or outward ſubmiſſion to an occaſional Cauſe, and a ſimple eſteem of any thing in reſpect of the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellency of its Nature, or the perfection which it doth or may poſſeſs.</p>
               <p n="9">IX. That kind of Honour which conſiſts in a ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſſion of the Mi<gap reason="illegible" resp="#UOM" extent="2 letters">
                     <desc>••</desc>
                  </gap> to the true Power, is due to God alone. <gap reason="illegible" resp="#UOM" extent="1 span">
                     <desc>〈…〉</desc>
                  </gap> none but God directly and
<pb n="38" facs="tcp:97672:89"/>abſolutely in the Powers which he hath ordain'd: And tho' we are oblig'd exactly to pay to our lawful Supe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riors, thoſe outward honours and ſubmiſſions, which humane Laws and Cuſtoms have eſtabliſh'd, yet all the ſubmiſſion of the Soul muſt be refer'd to God alone. It is mean and abject to fear the moſt excellent of created Beings: It is God alone whom we muſt fear in it. Nevertheleſs, we ſhould eſteem every thing proportic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nably to the excellence of its Nature, or the perfection which it poſſeſſes or is capable of poſſeſſing. So that the love of Benevolence, reſpect or relative and out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward Submiſſion, and ſimple Eſteem, are as I take it, the Three general Heads to which all the Duties that we owe to Men may be reduc'd.</p>
               <p n="10">X. There is this difference between the Duties which Religion obliges us to pay to God, and thoſe which So<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciety requires us to pay to Men; that the principal Duties of Religion are inward and ſpiritual, becauſe God ſearches the Hearts, and abſolutely ſpeaking, hath no need of his Creatures; whereas the Duties of Society are almoſt all external. For beſides that Men have no other way to know our inward Sentiments of them, but by outward and ſenſible marks, they all ſtand in need of one another, either for the preſervation, of their Life, or their particular inſtruction, or innumerable other things which abſolutely require a mutual aſſiſtance.</p>
               <p n="11">XI. Therefore to expect from other Men, inward and ſpiritual Duties which are due to God alone, a pure and uncompounded Spirit, the ſearcher of Hearts, the only independent and ſelf-ſufficient Being, is a diabo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lical Pride; this is to affect Dominion over ſpiritual Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtances, to attribute to our ſelves the quality of ſearcher of Hearts, and in a Word, to exact that which is no way our due, and which is wholly uſeleſs to us. For what ſignifies our inward adoration to other Men, or what good can theirs do us? If they faithfully perform what we deſire of them, what can we complain of? If they reſpect God himſelf, if they love and fear him in our Perſon, certainly we attribute to our ſelves power and independence, if we are not ſatisfied with this. <q>Servants,

               <p n="12">XII. There is ſo ſtrict an union between the Soul and the Body, and ſuch a mutual relation betwixt the Motions of theſe two Subſtances, that it is very diffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cult to draw near by the motion of our Body, to any Object which is the occaſional cauſe of Pleaſure, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out uniting our ſelves to it by the motion of our Love, as if it were the true cauſe of that Pleaſure. So like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe when the Imagination being dazled with the ſplen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dour which envirous the Great, falls down and pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrates it ſelf before them, it is difficult for the Soul not to follow that Motion, or at leaſt not to bow and lower it ſelf. It ſhould indeed proſtrate it ſelf, but then it muſt be before the power of the inviſible God, which it muſt honour in the Perſon of the Prince, where that Power viſibly reſides.</p>
               <p n="13">XIII. When the Body feeds on a delicious Fruit, the Soul which finds it ſelf in ſome meaſure happy by the Pleaſure it enjoys, ſhould then be affected with Love, but that Love ſhould be addreſs'd only to God, who alone doth and can act on it. But our Senſes being grown rebellious by Sin, diſlurb our Mind, they inſolently withdraw us from the preſence of God, and fix all our Thoughts on that impotent matter, which we hold in our Hands, and cruſh between our Teeth. They make us believe, that the Fruit it ſelf contains and communicates that grateful Taſt which delights us; and becauſe the power of God doth not appear viſible to our Eyes, we ſee nothing but the Fruit to which we can attribute the cauſe of our preſent Happi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs. Our Senſes were given us only for the preſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation of our ſenſible Being: What matter is it then to them from whence the Fruit comes, ſo they have
<pb n="40" facs="tcp:97672:90"/>it, or from whence the Pleaſure proceeds ſo they en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joy it?</p>
               <p n="14">XIV. So likewiſe when we are in the preſence of our Sovereign, our Imagination ſoon diſſipates all thoſe abſtract Ideas of an inviſible Power. The divine Law, the immutable Order, Reaſon is a Fantom which vaniſhes and diſappears when the Prince Commands, or when he ſpeaks with Authority. The Majeſty of the Prince, the ſenſible ſplendor of Greatneſs, that Air of reſpect and awe, which every one doth and ought to put on, ſo ſhake the Brain of an ambitious Man, and indeed of moſt Men, whoſe Paſſions are then ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cited, that there are but few People who have ſo much conſtancy and reſolution as to conſult the divine Law, to think on the power of the inviſible God, to retire into themſelves, and to hearken to the Judgments pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nounc'd within them by him who preſides immediately over all ſpiritual Beings.</p>
               <p n="15">XV. This ſtrict union of the Soul and Body, which Sin hath chang'd into a dependnece, is the cauſe that there is nothing more dangerous than the Converſati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on and Buſineſs of Courts, and that a Man ought to have a particular call, and ſtrong and extraordinary reaſons to make him engage in it. The Societies which are generally form'd there, are ſuch whoſe beginning and end is Ambition and Pleaſure, and being govern'd not by Reaſon or Faith, but by inconſiſtent and irregu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar Paſſions, they break every Day, and plunge Men in the greateſt Miſeries. Therefore ſuch as have not Courage and Conſtancy enough to perform their Duties to God, in the preſence of their Prince, in the hurry and perplexity of Buſineſs, or when they have too many People looking on them; in a Word, ſuch as ſuffer themſelves to be dazled, ſtunn'd and born down by the Converſation of the World, whatever it may be, ought to avoid it, and to place themſelves in a Sta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, where they may without conſtraint honour and love the true Power, conform themſelves to the divine Law, and render to God the inward and ſpiritual Duties. Theſe are indiſpenſable Duties; and certain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly we owe nothing to our Neighbour which may hin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der us from paying to God that which we indiſpenſably owe him.</p>
               <pb n="41" facs="tcp:97672:90"/>
               <p n="16">XVI. But beſides there is ſcarce any thing to be got by Men: Their Language is as corrupt as their Heart: It raiſes only falſe Ideas in the Mind, and excites only a love of ſenſible Objects. But their example is yet more dangerous. For beſides that it is not ſo confor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mable to Reaſon as their Diſcourſe, it is a living and a moving Language, which irreſiſtibly perſuades thoſe that do not ſtand upon their Guard, We often hear a thing ſaid, whithout any Thoughts of doing it: But we are ſo prone to Imitation, that we do mechanically what we ſee others do. There is no obligation on a Man to do what he only hears talk'd of, and doth not ſee pra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctis'd; but it is a violation of Society, 'tis the way to become Odious or Ridiculous, to be counted Whim<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſical and Capricious; in ſhort, 'tis look'd upon as a kind of Schiſm, to condemn the general practice of the World by a ſingular Conduct.</p>
               <p n="17">XVII. Nevertheleſs Charity and our natural Conſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tution oblige us many times to live in Society. Every Man cannot bear a retir'd and ſolitary Life, and thoſe leaſt of all to whom the Converſation of the World is moſt dangerous. They muſt See and be Seen, they muſt Talk and hear others Talk. Converſation without Paſſions refreſhes and ſtrengthens the Mind. Therefore there is a neceſſity of living amongſt Men. But then we ſhould chooſe ſuch as are Reaſonable, or at leaſt ſuch as are capable of hearing Reaſon, and ſubmitting to Faith, that ſo we may labour together for our mu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tual Sanctification. For we muſt build in this Life for Eternity, we muſt begin the eternal Society here be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low, we muſt make haſt while it is call'd to Day, to enter into the reſt of the Lord, and cauſe others to en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter too; that our Society may be with the Father and his Son Jeſus Chriſt in the unity of the Holy Ghoſt by an immortal Love, proceeding continually in relation to us, from the power and wiſdom of God, the per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>petual influence of which will be the efficacious cauſe of our Perfection and eternal Happineſs.</p>

               <head>CHAP. VII. <hi>The Duties of Eſteem are due to all Mankind, to the loweſt of Men, to the greateſt Sinners, to our Enemies and Perſecutors: To Merits, as well as to Natures. It is difficult to regulate exactly theſe Duties and thoſe of Benevolence, by reaſon of the difference of perſonal and relative Merits, and their various Combinations. A general rule, and the moſt certain one that can be given in this matter.</hi>
               </head>
               <p n="1">I. THE Three general Heads to which all the par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular Duties that we owe to other Men may be reduc'd, are, as I ſaid in the foregoing Chapter, ſimple Eſteem, which ought to be proportion'd to the excel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lence or perſection of every Being; Reſpect or a re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lative ſubmiſſion of the Mind, proportionable to the ſubordinate Power of intelligent occaſional Cauſes; and the love of Benevolence, which is due to all that are capable of enjoying thoſe Goods which we may poſſeſs in common with them.</p>
               <p n="2">II. Simple Eſteem is a Duty which we owe to all Mankind. Contempt is an Injury, and the greateſt of Injuries. There is nothing contemptible but nothing; for every real Being deſerves eſteem. And as Man is the nobleſt of the Creatures, it is a falſe Judgment, and an irregular Motion, to deſpiſe any Man, let him be what he will. The loweſt of Men may be exalted to the ſovereign Power; and the two firſt Kings which God gave to the <hi>Iſraelites,</hi> were taken as I may ſay, from the Dregs of the People. <hi>Saul</hi> of the loweſt Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mily of the leaſt of the twelve Tribes, found the King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom in ſeeking his Father's Aſſes.

               </p>
               <p n="3">III. But the Goſpel gives us yet another proſpect of Things. It teaches us that the Poor are the Mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers and the Brethren of Chriſt:
<note place="margin">Mat. 25.40. Luk. 6 20. Luk. 16.9.</note> That the Kingdom of Heaven belongs to them: And that they have pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er to receive their Friends into everlaſting Habitations. For tho' the Rich as well as the Poor are waſh'd by Baptiſm in the Blood of the Lamb, yet they defile themſelves ſo many ways with Pleaſure which inebriates them, and with Ambition which makes them forget their Title of Children of God, that Chriſt is always angry with them, and continually denounces woes againſt them in the Goſpel.

               </p>
               <p n="4">IV. Nor muſt we Eſteem, and give outward marks of our Eſteem to the Poor only and to the loweſt of Men, but alſo to Sinners, and to thoſe who commit the great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt Crimes. Their Life is abominable, their practice is odious and contemptible, we muſt never approve it, tho' it be ſet off with all the ſplendor of Greatneſs. But ſtill their Perſon merits our Eſteem. For nothing deſerves contempt but nothing, and Sin which is truly nothing, which corrupts Man's Nature, annihilates his Merit, but doth not deſtroy the excellence of his Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon. The greateſt of Sinners may, by the aſſiſtance of Heaven, become pure and holy as the Angels: He may enjoy eternal Happineſs with us, and take place of us in the Kingdom of God. We ſhould have com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paſſion of his Miſery, not that which afflicts and makes him uneaſy, but that which corrupts him; not of his pains, but of his diſorders, which put him out of a ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pacity
<pb n="44" facs="tcp:97672:92"/>of actually poſſeſſing with us thoſe good Things which he may enjoy, without depriving us of them.</p>
               <p n="5">V. But beſides, what right have we to judge of Mens ſecret Intentions? It is God alone who ſearches the Hearts. He that commits a Crime, doth it perhaps againſt his Will; his Mind is weak and diſturb'd, his flaming and outragious Paſſions have, it may be, de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>priv'd him in a moment of the uſe of his Liberty: But ſuppoſing him to have acted freely; his contrite and penitent Heart hath perhaps obtain'd pardon of his Sin, or will obtain it to morrow; a day happy for him, and it may be fatal to you, by your irrecoverable fall, for a puniſhment of your Pride.</p>
               <p n="6">VI. Laſtly, the contempt of Mens Perſons is not only injurious and wrongful, but it alſo puts him who is ſo unwiſe as to ſhew it by outward ſigns, out of a con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition of having a charitable correſpondence with the Perſon deſpis'd, or of ever being ſerviceable to him. For Men will have no communication with thoſe that deſpiſe them; they do not naturally enter into Society with others, nor do them any good, but with hope of a return; they will not follow a Trade, when they expect always to loſe, and never to get any thing by it; and they never expect any good from thoſe that are ſo unjuſt as to deſpiſe them: For contempt is a certain ſign, not only that they actually want Charity and Benevolence, but alſo that they are very far from ever having any.</p>
               <p n="7">VII. As to our Enemies and Perſecutors, it is cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain that Eſteem is a Duty more general than Benevo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lence. There are ſome Goods which we are not bound to wiſh our Enemies, for the Love which we owe to our ſelves, obliges, or permits us at leaſt not to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſire that they may have the Power to hurt us: So that we may in ſome meaſure want Benevolence for our Perſecutors, without failing of our Duties toward them. But the Perſecution of our Enemies ought not of it ſelf to diminiſh the Eſteem that is due to them, but rather encreaſe it in this reſpect, that we ſhould give them more ſenſible and more frequent Teſtimonies of it: A Man may paſs by his Friend, or even his Father with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out ſaluting him; this is no affront to them: But it is an injury to his Enemy, not to pay him this Duty, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe
<pb n="45" facs="tcp:97672:92"/>his Enemy hath not the ſame Thoughts of him that other Men have. He hath reaſon to believe it done out of contempt, whereas a Friend will look upon it as meer Inadvertency.</p>
               <p n="8">VIII. But beſides, there is nothing that diſunites Men ſo much as Contempt; for no Man would be counted a Cypher in the Society of which he is a Member; no Man would be the loweſt part of that Body which he compoſes with others. So that when Mens Minds are already irritated, when they are once ſeparated by any Enmity, they can never be join'd again, if the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tempt be open and viſible. Whereas on the contrary, deadly Enmities may be reconcil'd, where Men reci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>procally pay the Duties of Eſteem to one another, and thereby ſhew that they are ſo far from pretending to a higher Rank in the Society which they would form, that they willingly give it to others, and do Juſtice both to them and themſelves, according to the Judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment which they make of their own, and others Merit. Self love and a ſecret Pride, do not ſuffer us long to conſider him as our Enemy, who willingly gives us Proofs that he is perſuaded of our Worth and Excel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lence.</p>
               <p n="9">IX. But if we come ſhort in the Duties of Eſteem in reſpect of our Enemies, or thoſe that make no Figure in the World, we exceed in them as to our Friends, or ſuch as are conſpicuous for their Birth, Riches, or any other extraordinary Qualification. The Brain is ſo fram'd for the good of each particular Perſon, and for that of Society in general, as it relates to this Life, that the Body mechanically puts on an Air of Eſteem and Reſpect for every thing that comes from our Friends, and from thoſe who are in a condition to do us any Kindneſs. The eſteem which we have for Perſons, ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tends it ſelf to every thing that belongs to them.
<note place="margin">Eccleſ. 13.23.</note> 
                  <q>When a rich Man ſpeaketh, ſaith the Son of <hi>Sirach,</hi> every Man holdeth his Tongue, and look what he ſaith; they extol it to the Clouds: But if the poor Man ſpeak, they ſay, What fellow is this?</q> Our Machine is ſet to this pitch. Two Lutes tun'd together, give the ſame ſound; and when they are near one another, if one be touch'd, the other will move of it ſelf: So our Friends are tun'd to us; he that touches one, ſhakes
<pb n="46" facs="tcp:97672:93"/>the other. Thoſe whoſe favour we have an intereſt to maintain, are always in the right: They mutually im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pel, and are impell'd by us: They deceive us, and we again deceive them by a rebound, which neither they nor we are ſenſible of. The Wheels of the Machine will go on in their Motion: Now the Body ſpeaks only for the Body; this is a thing we cannot too care<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully obſerve, For Opinion, or the contagion of the Imagination is the moſt prolifick Root of thoſe Errors and Diſorders, which lay waſt the Chriſtian World. We ſhould therefore retire into our ſelves every mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, and compare that which Men ſay, with the an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwers of the inward Truth. We ſhould conſult Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon, which puts every thing in its proper place, and doth not confound the Eſteem which we owe to Mens Perſons, with the Contempt which is due to their Fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lies. The approbation we give to the impertinences of our Friends, confirms them in their Errors; and the Reſpect that is ſhewn to every thing which comes from Perſons of Quality, ſwells them ſo with Pride, that they attribute to themſelves a kind of Infallibili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, and think they have a right to ſay and do what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever comes in their Head; not that we ſhould repre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hend them openly neither: They are extremely ten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der; and we can ſcarce touch them, without hurting and offending them. Our Duties in relation to them, muſt be guided by the Rules of Prudence and Cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity; but we muſt not abuſe them by ſordid Flattery, after we have been deceiv'd our ſelves by that admi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable Relation which God hath put between our own Bodies, and thoſe that are about us, for the good of Society: Which Relation on the Soul's part is indeed chang'd into a dependence by Sin, but ought ſtill to be govern'd by Reaſon; and when there is occaſion, check'd and reprimanded by it.</p>
               <p n="10">X. That all the Judgments and Motions of our E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſteem, as well as thoſe outward Actions which are the Marks and Effects of it, may be conformable to the divine Law, the immutable Order; we muſt obſerve that not only Mens Perſons, but alſo their Merits, require our Eſteem. As to Perſons, nothing is more eaſie than to acquit our ſelves of this Duty; for equality of Eſteem is due to equality of Natures. But
<pb n="47" facs="tcp:97672:93"/>it is very difficult to proportion our Eſteem according to the Merits of Men. For beſides, that their true and real Worth is known only to God, their natural Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rits have ſo many different Relations, which ſhould en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creaſe or diminiſh our Eſteem, as well as our Reſpect and Benevolence toward them, that it is impoſſible for finite Minds, as ours are, to know exactly the Duties we owe them; ſo that we are many times at a loſs which way to determine our ſelves in this Matter.</p>
               <p n="11">XI. Merits in general, may be divided into free and natural, civil and religious Merits. Free Merits are thoſe which proceed from a good uſe of the Liberty of the Mind. Natural Merits conſiſt in eminent Quali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties of Mind and Body. Civil and Religious Merits ariſe from the Offices Men bear either in Church or State, and from ſuch Qualifications as are proper for the diſcharge of thoſe Offices. All Perfection is valuable in it ſelf; but many times it is much more comparatively or relatively. A Diamond is not ſo perfect as a Fly; but it is a great deal more valuable, becauſe of the Uſe Men make of it. Alſo thoſe Beings which have no other Perfection but that of their own Nature, are preferable to thoſe which have acquir'd Perfections. A rough Diamond hath not ſo much Beauty as Glaſs well cut and poliſh'd; but it hath much more Value, as Things go. So that a Man might juſtly be counted a Fool, who would play the Philoſopher ſo much, as to prefer a Fly before an Emerald; and to look upon a rough Diamond, of very great Value, as no better than a Pebble.</p>
               <p n="12">XII. For to judge rightly of the Eſteem we ought to make of Things and Perſons, it is not ſufficient to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſider them in themſelves, but we muſt alſo examine the ſeveral Relations which they may have to others of far greater Value. The favour of the Prince gives a luſtre to the vileſt Perſons; and the Eſteem Men have for Things, ſhould regulate their Price, and conſequently our outward and relative Eſteem, unleſs we reſolve to deſpiſe Men too, and make our ſelves ridiculous and contemptible. Only we muſt take care not to let our Mind to be corrupted by the Judgments that are com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monly made of Things. Our Eſteem muſt be only re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lative, if the worth of the Thing be but relative; for
<pb n="48" facs="tcp:97672:94"/>tho' Men eſteem Gold and Silver more than Copper and Iron, or the organis'd Bodies of Flies; yet we muſt not pay the Duty of Eſteem to Gold and Silver, but to Men who make a wrong Judgment of them. We muſt not judge of Perſons or Things as Men do, who attri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bute to the Objects of their Paſſions imaginary Perfe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctions: But whether they are deceiv'd in their Judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments or not, we ſhould have a relative Eſteem for that which they eſteem perhaps without Reaſon; becauſe in human Society, the Worth of Things is generally meaſur'd by the Eſteem Men have of them.</p>
               <p n="13">XIII. The relative Merit of Men is many times much greater than their perſonal Merit, and ſince our Duties are to be govern'd as well by the former as the latter; I ſay again, That nothing is more difficult than to judge rightly of what we ought to do in the infinite combinations of theſe different Merits. Things may fall out ſo ſometimes, that we muſt unavoidably come ſhort in the Payment of what we owe, either to a Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lation in ſuch a degree, or to a Man that hath done us ſuch a Service, or who bears ſuch an Office in the So<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciety, and is ſerviceable to the State in ſuch a capa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>city. What muſt we do in this Caſe? What is the common Meaſure whereby we may preciſely diſcover the Proportion of our Duties? For tho' it be certainly contain'd in the immutable Order, yet it is not exact<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly known to us; and if it were, yet many times there are ſo many Relations to compare, that we ſhould never know what to reſolve on, if we ſtaid till Evidence pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciſely noted to us every thing that we ought to do.</p>
               <p n="14">XIV. We know well enough, that all other things being equal, we ſhould prefer ſome Relations before others; our Relations before our Friends, and our Prince before them both. But muſt we prefer one Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lation before ſix or eight Friends? A Relation who is our Enemy, before a particular Friend? Herein lies the difficulty: For we muſt at the ſame time have re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gard to the Rights of Kindred, of Friendſhip and of Society. So that it often happens, that we are oblig'd to prefer an Enemy before a Friend; an Enemy who is a Friend of our Relations, eſteem'd by the Prince, and ſerviceable to the State, before a Friend, who is a Perſon uſeleſs to the Publick, or hath little or no affe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction
<pb n="49" facs="tcp:97672:94"/>for thoſe who ought to be moſt dear to us. Therefore there is no general Rule for the Government of our ſelves in the Duties of Eſteem, Reſpect and Benevolence, which we owe to other Men, but what is liable to a great many exceptions. And that which extremely perplexes all that can be ſaid in this Mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, is; That the Duties of Eſteem, Reſpect and Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nevolence, are of different kinds; and many times in the ſame kind, we ought to prefer one Man as to the Duties of Benevolence, before another, to whom we abſolutely owe the Duties of Eſteem and Reſpect.</p>
               <p n="15">XV. Seeing then the Order of our Duties is chang'd and govern'd by the different Circumſtances of Things, which it is not poſſible to foreſee; every Man ſhould carefully examine them, and retire into himſelf, to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſult the immutable Law, without regarding thoſe falſe Intereſts which the Paſſions continually repreſent; and when he finds himſelf at a loſs, he ſhould have recourſe to ſuch as are better skill'd than I in theſe matters; he ſhould conſult Perſons of the greateſt Charity, Pru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence and Capacity, rather than thoſe who have their Memory only fill'd with general Rules, which are in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſufficient to give a deciſion in particular circumſtances, and many times have neither Senſe nor Charity. The only general Rule that I ſhall venture to give at preſent, a Rule which is not much follow'd, but which ſeems to me to be the moſt certain one that can be given, is this; That we ſhould prefer the Laws of Friendſhip in Jeſus Chriſt, and of the eternal Society, before the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon Rights of a Friendſhip and a Society which muſt end with our Life. I ſhall explain my ſelf more par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticularly.</p>
               <p n="16">XVI. That which is finite, how great ſoever it be, hath of it ſelf no proportion to infinity. Ten thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſand Ages, in reſpect of eternity, is nothing. The proportion of the Univerſe, to immenſe and boundleſs Spaces, can be expreſs'd only by a Cypher. An Unite divided by a thouſand Millions of Cyphers, by a pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greſſion from one to a thouſand Millions, inſtead of from One to Ten, would be a Fraction infinitely too great to expreſs this proportion, for indeed there is none; this is my Poſition. Now we ſhall enjoy God in the other life, and enjoy him for ever. Therefore
<pb n="50" facs="tcp:97672:95"/>the poſſeſſion of the Empire of the Univerſe, in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpect of the poſſeſſion of the true Good; and the time of the enjoyment of this Empire, compar'd with the eternity of the life to come, are Cyphers; there is no proportion between them: They are totally eclips'd and annihilated by the preſence of Eternity. Human Greatneſs, and Pleaſures which paſs away with our life; nay, let us join whatever we can think of for our Satisfaction; all this diſappears when we reflect a lit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle, and conſider that we are immortal: It is nothing, and ought to be counted for nothing. This, I think, every one will allow.</p>
               <p n="17">XVII. Now let us obſerve this Principle, and we ſhall ſee, that he who is an occaſion of falling to one ſingle Perſon, is more cruel than the inhuman <hi>Pha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>laris;</hi> that it is juſt that he ſhould ſuffer, like that wretched Prince, the ſame Fire into which he hath made others fall; and that it were better for him, as our Saviour ſpeaks, <hi>That he were thrown into the Sea with a Milſtone about his Neck.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="18">XVIII. On the contrary, we ſhall ſee that he who labours under Jeſus Chriſt, in the building of the eternal Temple, is incomparably more valuable than the greateſt Architect that ever was. There is nothing now to be ſeen of the Temple of the great <hi>Solomon,</hi> the Habita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the living God, and the Glory of a whole Peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple; but this Man's Work ſhall remain for ever.</p>
               <p n="19">XIX. We ſhall ſee clearly, that a deform'd Body, a rude and unpoliſh'd Mind, a lively and irregular Ima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gination, a Man of no reputation or fortune in the World, without Friends, and without any Qualifications to recommend him; that ſuch a Man, I ſay, if he be truly pious, if he fears and loves his God, is infinitely more worthy of our Eſteem, than the moſt beautiful Man in the World, the moſt careſs'd and honour'd for his admirable Qualities, but with ſomething leſs Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion. Certainly no one will dare to ſay, That God the righteous Judge, prefers this Man before the other. Therefore we alſo are bound to prefer the other if we are ſufficiently convinc'd of the Difference of their Piety.</p>
               <pb n="51" facs="tcp:97672:95"/>
               <p n="20">XX. A Man may eſteem the quality of a Phyſician more than that of a Lawyer; this is indifferent, and depends on Cuſtoms, which vary according to times and places. But to eſteem the quality of a Prince more than that of a Chriſtian, to value the Title of a Gentleman more than that of a Prieſt, after the Order of the Son of God; this is not indifferent: Not but that a Man owes to his Prince other kind of Duties, than he doth to the Miniſter of his Pariſh; the Prince hath the ſovereign Power, and therefore he muſt pay him the higheſt Reſpect, and an exact Obedience in all things.</p>
               <p n="21">XXI. I have two Relations, or two Friends; one of them is an honeſt Miſſionary, who labours, with ſuc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſs, in the building of the Church; the other an ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>compliſh'd Perſon in all human Sciences, a great Mathe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>matician, an excellent Philoſopher, one that knows the Hiſtories of all Nations, and ſpeaks their Lan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guages: But I do not find that his Learning is ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viceable to the eternal Society; nay, I think I diſco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver the contrary. Now which of theſe two Perſons is the moſt valuable? both of them ſtand in need of my Aſſiſtance; Which ſhall I prefer? Certainly the good Prieſt, the honeſt Preacher whom the World deſpiſes, and not the learned Gentleman whom the World adores. I may perhaps give him greater marks of eſteem in many Caſes, for fear of diſguſting his nice and ſque<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſh Conſtitution. For thoſe that have great Talents in appearance, or according to the judgment of Men, think every thing their due; and that we may not of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fend them, we may ſometimes give them thoſe honours which they do not deſerve; for our outward Actions ſhould be govern'd by the Rules of Charity, and ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times with reſpect to the falſe Judgments of Men. But for my inward Eſteem and Benevolence, I owe them to thoſe who have the greateſt Relation to the eternal So<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciety before all others, tho' they were my profeſs'd Ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies, and the loweſt of Men in the Eyes of the corrupt World.</p>
               <p n="22">XXII. Sometimes Circumſtances may fall out ſo, that a Man muſt either give ſcandal to his Neighbour, or loſe his honour and his life. He cannot well defend Truth, without ridiculing him that attacks it, and ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſing his Party. He cannot ſerve his Friend, or it may
<pb n="52" facs="tcp:97672:96"/>be his Prince without violating the Chriſtian Charity which he owes to a ſtranger, and being the cauſe of his Damnation. What muſt a Man reſolve in theſe, and innumerable other the like Caſes? Nothing is more clear, according to the Principle which I have laid down. For ſince every thing that relates to infinity, becomes infinite it ſelf by that Relation; no regard ought to be had to the Rights of a temporary Friendſhip or Society, when the eternal Society is concern'd.</p>
               <p n="23">XXIII. But yet we muſt take care, that in prefer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring the ſpiritual Advantage before all other Things; we do not offend our Friends without cauſe: For we ſhould always do juſtice, before we exerciſe Charity. A Man muſt not ſteal to marry a Daughter, who he fears will otherwiſe be ruin'd. The Grace of Chriſt may re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>medy thoſe diſorders. He muſt not give his Friend oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caſion to break with him, by neglecting thoſe Duties which he hath a Right to expect from him, nor wound one Man's Conſcience to cure anothers. We ſhould govern the Duties of Charity by Prudence, and endea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour to foreſee the Conſequences of our Actions. But I think, I may ſay in general, That there is not a more certain and comprehenſive Rule than this, to have always a regard to the Rights of the eternal Society, when they are mingled with other Intereſts, as it moſt commonly happens.</p>

               <p n="1">I. THe greateſt part of what hath been ſaid touching the Duties of Eſteem, may be alſo applied to the Duties of Benevolence and Reſpect. However, I think it neceſſary to ſay ſomething farther of them here, that the Nature and Obligations of them may be more diſtin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctly underſtood.</p>
               <pb n="53" facs="tcp:97672:96"/>
               <p n="2">II. As to the Duties of Benevolence or Charity, we owe them to all Men in general; and tho' there be ſome particular Goods, which we ought not to wiſh nor procure to ſome Perſons, nor in ſome Circumſtances, yet the true Goods which we may give without de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>priving our ſelves or others of them, ought never to be refus'd to any one whatſoever. We ſhould never conceal Truth, the nouriſhment of the Soul, from thoſe that are capable of receiving it. We ſhould give good example to all the World. No one ſhould ever be excepted in the publick Prayers and Offices of the Church. The Sacraments ſhould never be refus'd to ſuch as are rightly diſpos'd to receive them. Theſe are the true Goods, which relate to the eternal Society. And ſince God would have all Men to be ſav'd, and to come to the knowledge of the Truth; he that refuſes to any one the Duties of Chriſtian Charity, oppoſes the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſigns of God, and undermines the Foundation of that Society which we have with him by Jeſus Chriſt.</p>
               <p n="3">III. But for the good Things of this World, as they are not properly Goods, as their real worth depends on the relation they may have to the true Goods, in ſhort as they are ſuch things as cannot be communicated without dividing; it very often happens that we are oblig'd not to impart them to ſome Perſons. For in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance, if a Father out of too much Indulgence to his Children who are debauch'd, or prone to debauchery, furniſhes them with Mony; he is the cauſe of their diſorders, and wrongs the Poor who ſtand in need of his aſſiſtance: As he that gives a Sword to a mad Man, or a Man tranſported with Paſſion, is really the cauſe of the Murder that enſues. The Prodigal robs the Poor, and by his indiſcreet Liberalities kills the Souls of his riotous Companions: And he that gives a drunken Servant the liberty to drink as much as he pleaſes, doth him a kindneſs which is forbidden by the Laws of Cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity and Benevolence. In a Word, he that gives any power to impotent Minds, which can neither conſult, nor follow Reaſon, is the cauſe of their deſtruction, and of all the Miſchiefs which ſpring from the abuſe of Power.</p>
               <pb n="54" facs="tcp:97672:97"/>
               <p n="4">IV. Theſe are undeniable Truths, and the reaſon of them is plain. Mony, for inſtance, is not properly a Good, becauſe we cannot truly poſſeſs or enjoy it, for ſpiritual Subitances cannot poſſeſs Bodies: It is ſuch a Good as cannot be communicated without diviſion, and therefore the love of Benevolence ſhould diſtri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bute it in ſuch a manner, that it may be uſeful, and become a Good, or rather a proper means of acquiring Good, to thoſe who receive it. For otherwiſe, there is a double breach of our Duty toward our Neigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bour: We hurt thoſe to whom we give it, and we injure all thoſe who by the Laws of Charity have a juſt title to it, to whom we do not give it.</p>
               <p n="5">V. But Pain and Diſgrace, which in themſelves are real Evils, become good in many caſes; and the love of Benevolence which we owe to all Men, obliges us to inflict them on thoſe that deſerve it, over whom we have authority, to reclaim them from their diſorders by the fear of Puniſhment. She is a cruel Mother that will not ſuffer a gangren'd Arm of her Child to be cut off: But ſhe is much more cruel, that ſuffers his Mind and Heart to be corrupted by Eaſe and Pleaſure. He that ſees his Friend ruin'd by underhand Intrigues, and takes no notice of it, or for his own advantage enters into a correſpondence in prejudice of the Friendſhip he hath vow'd, is a perfidious Friend, and not fit for hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mane Society. But he is much more perfidious, who for fear of grieving and diſpleaſing us, ſuffers us to fall into Hell, or by gratifying our Paſſions, joyns with the only Enemies we have to blind and deſtroy us.</p>
               <p n="6">VI. Who then is he that can render to his Neighbour the Duties of Charity or Benevolence? Certainly he that knows the vanity of tranſitory Enjoyments, and the ſolidity of the future Goods, the ſtability of the heavenly <hi>Jeruſalem,</hi> built on that immoveable Rock, the well beloved Son of the Almighty: He that com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pares Time with Eternity, and following the great principle of Chriſtian Morality, meaſures the Duties of Civil Friendſhip and Society by the Rules of that Society which is joyn'd here upon Earth by Grace, and cemented for ever in Heaven by the perpetual com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munion of a Good which ſhall be given whole and en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tire
<pb n="55" facs="tcp:97672:97"/>to all, and entire to every one of us: He in fine, that continually meditates on that divine Society which we ought to have with the Father by the Son in the unity of the Holy Spirit, the mutual love of the Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther and the Son, and the Fountain of that happy Love which ſhall for ever unite us to God. He and he alone is capable of paying to his Neighbour the Duties of Benevolence. All other Men are deſtitute of Charity, and are ſo far from loving us with the love which is due to us, and is contain'd in the Second great Commandment of the Chriſtian Law, that they do not ſo much as know their eſſential Obligations toward us. The Coreſpondence they have with us, their Friend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip, their Society will rather be the fatal cauſe of our Miſery, than the happy foundation of our Joy and Tranquility.</p>
               <p n="7">VII. Let People ſay what they will, that we ought to ſeparate the Laws of civil Society from thoſe of Chriſtian Charity, to me they ſeem inſeparable in the practical part. The Citizen of my earthly City is already by Grace a Citizen of the holy City; the Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject of my Prince is a Domeſtick of the Houſe of God. <q>Now ye are no more Strangers and Foreigners,
<note place="margin">Eph. 2.19.</note> ſaith S. <hi>Paul,</hi> but Fellow-citizens with the Saints, and of the Houſhold of God; and are built upon the Foun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>darion of the Apoſtles and Prophets, Jeſus Chriſt himſelf being the chief Corner-ſtone; in whom all the Building fitly fram'd together, groweth unto an holy Temple in the Lord.</q> Shall I then engage in the deſigns of a Friend who ſeeks to advance his For<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tunes here upon Earth, and hazards the poſſeſſion which he hath in Heaven? Shall I by my Counſels and Friends favour his Ambition, and advance one who wants that conſtancy and reſolution that are neceſſary for ſubordinate Governments, to a ſtation which all wiſe and underſtanding Men are afraid of? A Friend trembles for his Friend, when he beholds him in the midſt of dangers. A Mother is frighted, when ſhe ſees her Child clambring up a ſteep Place. And ſhall not I be in fear for a Relation, for a dear Friend in Chriſt, whom I ſee environ'd on all ſides with dreadful preci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pices, and yet ſtill climbing higher to a place that makes the ſtrongeſt Heads giddy?</p>
               <pb n="56" facs="tcp:97672:98"/>
               <p n="8">VIII. The preſent Life ſhould be conſider'd with relation to that which is to follow, and ſhall be fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low'd by no other. The Society which we now form, is no otherwiſe durable, than as it is the beginning of that which ſhall never have an end. It is for this ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond Society, that the Firſt is ordain'd: It is to merit Heaven that we live upon Earth. I repeat this Truth often, becauſe it is neceſſary that we ſhould be through<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly convinc'd of it. We ſhould engrave it deeply on our Memory. We ſhould inceſſantly revolve it in our Mind, for fear leſt the continual action of ſenſible Objects ſhould blot out the remembrance of it. If we are fully convinc'd of this Truth, if we make it the Rule of our Judgments and deſires, we ſhall not be concern'd at the want of thoſe things which we ſhall not much eſteem: We ſhall not then take ſuch meaſures as tend only to make us happy upon Earth, and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the time of recompence; but ſuch as lead us whi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther we ought to direct our aim, to that perfection which makes us acceptable in the ſight of God, and worthy to enter into an eternal Society with him through Chriſt our Lord.</p>
               <p n="9">IX. But becauſe Men have but a weak and ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtracted Idea, of the greatneſs of future Goods, they ſeldom think on them, and when they do they are not affected with them; for only ſenſible Ideas, ſhake the Soul, only the preſence of Good and Evil touches, and puts it in Motion. On the contrary, the Imagi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation and Senſes being continually and forcibly ſtruck by the Objects which are round about us, we are con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtantly thinking on them, and always with ſome mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of Paſſion; and as we naturally judge of the ſoli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dity of any good by the impreſſion it makes on our Mind, we look upon them with Eſteem, we deſire them with Impatience, and embrace them with Pleaſure. And therefore we think that thoſe Perſons have no Kind<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs nor Friendſhip for us, who ſtop us in our career, in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtead of joyning with us to catch the Prey which eſcapes out of our Hands.</p>
               <p n="10">X. Obſerve but a pack of Dogs, when they are going out a Hunting how they rejoyce, and as it were careſs and congratulate one another. Eager for the ſport, they mechanically excite each other, and many times
<pb n="57" facs="tcp:97672:98"/>the Huntſman himſelf, by leaping and jumping, mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions which reciprocally require the like, for all Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chines, at leaſt thoſe of the ſame Species, are narnrally made to imitate one another. If there be any one hotter than the reſt, that ranges too wide, and ſtarts the Game too far off, him they ſhut up and leave him behind. But what a howling and crying there is! What ſenſible expreſſions of an extreme Grief! All this is but Mechaniſm and Clock-work. Juſt ſo it is with thoſe that know not the true Good, when any Paſſion poſſeſſes them. If you do not aſſiſt and further their deſigns, if you thwart and oppoſe them, they will always be reproaching and exclaiming againſt you, that you neglect the Duties of Society, of Friendſh<gap reason="illegible" resp="#UOM" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>p and Affinity, that you make them miſerable, and pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſs your ſelf their Enemy. If you endeavour to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vince them by Reaſon, preſently you are a Stoick, a <hi>Cato.</hi> If you go about to reſtrain them by conſidera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions of Religion, then you are preciſe and bigotted. The Wheels of the Machine are ſet a going, and will go on a long time. Devout and pious Men will ſtill be Whimſical and Capricious, without Breeding, Friend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip or Civility. They will always be ſhun'd, as not fit for humane Society: For indeed there can be no Society but between ſuch as hope for the ſame kind of advantages. But pious Men ſeek after the true Goods, for which thoſe others have no inclination, who have no taſt, no ſenſe of any thing but the objects of their Paſſions.</p>
               <p n="11">XI. Good Men being truly animated by Charity, never break Friendſhip with thoſe that live diſorderly out of anger or reſentment. They ſtill hope to reclaim them by their Example, their Patience, and their Counſels favour'd and aſſiſted by Grace. As they are convinc'd of the Truth of their own Sentiments, and throughly affected with the ſweetneſs of the true Goods, of which they have already a kind of foretaſt; they think of nothing but to make others ſee what they ſee themſelves. They would fain make them reliſh the inexhauſtible Fountain of all Pleaſures. The abhor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence which they have for Vice inſpires and animates them, and makes them ſpeak in ſuch a Dialect as ſ<gap reason="illegible" resp="#UOM" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>rikes a damp on thoſe that really find themſelves happy,
<pb n="58" facs="tcp:97672:99"/>when they follow the agreeable motion of their Paſſions. This is the cauſe that a vitious and debauch'd Man, and by debauch'd I mean all thoſe that do not look up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on the immutable Order as their Law, or the inviolable Rule of their Actions, thoſe that think Reaſon an in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſupportable Yoke: This, I ſay, is the cauſe that a debauch'd Man conſiders thoſe of a regular Life as his Enemies, that he avoids their Converſation with a kind of averſion and abhorrence, and will have no Cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reſpondence with them, being inwardly perſuaded that they will not quit the ſolid and ſubſtantial Goods to engage in his deſigns, and joyn with him in the pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſuit of Fantoms, which vaniſh and diſappear at the Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment that they are embrac'd.</p>
               <p n="12">XII. Theſe ſort of People are always complaining that the Laws of Religion are confounded with thoſe of Nature, that devout and godly Men are good for nothing in the World, and that they are obſtinate and ill-bred People. They would have Folks converſe with them like kind Relations, faithful Friends, or true-hearted Country-men, and not like Men pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſſeſs'd with Notions which they do not reliſh nor approve. But this is not poſſible to be done. A Man cannot act but according to his own Light. Shall he that ſees clearly, ſuffer a blind Man to fall into a Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cipice, and not call out to him and ſtop him? And would the blind Man think you have reaſon to com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plain of the kindneſs that is done him, and ſay to his Friend, let me alone: Do you think you ſee better than I? We are all blind: Believe me, you are prejudic'd. Am not I more concern'd in my own preſervation than you? You had better go blindly along with me, for I am ſure I am in the fineſt way in the World.</p>
               <p n="13">XIII. If I ſerve my Friend according to his deſires, I ruin him and my ſelf too. This is the prejudice that blinds me. Perhaps he hath ſome reaſon to complain of me; but he is unreaſonable, if he imagines that I renounce his Friendſhip, or if he renounces mine. If my Friend were not a Chriſtian, or not capable of being one; if our whole Being were to be annihilated by Death, then I could converſe with him in ſuch a manner as he deſires, and have the ſame Friendſhip for him that he hath for me; I could then be a good
<pb n="59" facs="tcp:97672:99"/>Relation, a good Friend, or a good Country-man ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to the Idea he hath of thoſe Qualities. But Eternity changes the Face of things, and it is the great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt madneſs in the World not to have a regard to it.</p>
               <p n="14">XIV. A Chriſtian, a Prieſt, a Gentleman and a Friend are not four different Perſons. When the Gentleman is in Hell, what will become of the Prieſt and the Friend? If theſe Qualities are inſeparable in the ſame Perſon, it is evident that the Prieſt is deceiv'd, if he thinks he hath a right to act the part of the Gentle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man: And if I give him different Advice according to his different Qualities, certainly I miſlead and abuſe him. When Qualities are inſeparable, the moſt ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellent of them ſhould govern all the reſt; and tho' we may abſtract and diſtinguiſh them when we only reaſon in the air, yet when we come to act, we muſt joyn them all together.</p>
               <p n="15">XV. Whether therefore we give Alms to the Poor, viſit the Sick or thoſe that are in Priſon, inſtruct the Ignorant, aſſiſt our Friends with our Counſels, or do any other action of Charity or Duty; we ſhould re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fer all to the Salvation of our Neighbour, we ſhould always conſider that we live among Chriſtians, and therefore that we ought to do ſuch Actions as are re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quir'd of us by the eternal Society which we all have in Chriſt Jeſus. We ſhould give our aſſiſtance to Sin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners, Hereticks, and even Heathens themſelves, becauſe they are capable of entring into this bleſſed Society: And we ſhould be more concern'd for thoſe that are excluded out of it, than for thoſe that are in ſlavery in a ſtrange Country. We ſhould be more ſollicitous to make them come into it, than to preſerve to them this miſerable Life: a Life which we ought not much to value, but only as it is a Time which relates to Eternity, and may deſerve it by the Grace which Chriſt, the High-Prieſt of the true Goods, diſtributes to Men, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by ſollicits them to enter into a communion of the ſame happineſs with him.</p>
               <p n="16">XVI. As to the Duties of Reſpect or external and relative Submiſſion, they are due to Power, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore we cannot proportion them according to the merits of Perſons, nor regulate them by our own Light, with
<pb n="60" facs="tcp:97672:100"/>reſpect to the intereſts of our eternal Society in Chriſt. We muſt follow the Cuſtoms and Laws of the State in which God hath plac'd us. It is a Duty of Juſtice to pay Reſpect and Tribute to thoſe to whom God hath given Authority over us. It is all one whether they be good or bad, nay whether they be Chriſtians or not: Whether they make a good or a bad uſe of our Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tributions. And the reaſon of this is, becauſe it is God whom we Honour in their Perſons; for all Honour is relative, and muſt be ultimately refer'd to him alone who really poſſeſſes Power. So that it is an injury and a wrong to our Prince, to deny him the Reſpects which are due to him; and it is a formal diſobedience againſt the King of Kings, to refuſe to ſubmit our ſelves, and give ſenſible marks of our Submiſſion to thoſe whom he hath appointed his Lieutenants and Vice<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gerents upon Earth. The primitive Chriſtians paid to the Roman Emperors, even thoſe who cruelly per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſecuted Chriſt himſelf in his Members, all the Reſpect, Submiſſion and relative Honor that was due to their participated Power: Well knowing that Honour is properly due to God alone, and muſt be refer'd ſolely to him,
<note place="margin">1 Tim. 1.17.</note> according to S. <hi>Paul</hi>'s Words, <q>Unto the King eternal, immortal, inviſible, the only wiſe God, be Honour and Glory.</q> They knew that the Duties of Reſpect ought not to be proportion'd to the intereſt of the Church, or rather that they ought to be refer'd thither, becauſe that is the great, or indeed the only deſign of God; but that this is never better done, than when Chriſtians pay thoſe Duties with all poſſible exactneſs: For indeed this is the right way to oblige ſovereign Princes, who are always jealous of their Glory and Authority, to favour Chriſtian Socie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties more than any other in their Dominions. But I muſt diſcourſe more at large of our Duties as they re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>late to the different kinds of Society which we form with other Men.</p>

The Duties of Reſpect depend on the Laws and Cuſtoms obſerv'd in every State, and conſiſt in certain out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward and ſenſible marks of the Submiſſion which the Mind pays to God in the Perſon of it's Superiors. Thoſe Duties vary according to the different Circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtances of Times and Places. Sometimes Subjects pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrate themſelves before their Prince; ſometimes they put one Knee to the Ground, or both: At other times they only make a profound reverence and ſtand un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cover'd; and ſometimes alſo they remain cover'd in his Preſence, without loſing the Reſpect which is due to him. Theſe are arbitrary Ceremonies, and are govern'd by Uſe and Cuſtom.</p>
               <p n="2">II. But that which is eſſential to Morality, is that the Soul it ſelf ſhould be touch'd with Reſpect in the Preſence of the Prince, who is the Image of the true Power: and that in ſuch a proportion as the Prince actually exerciſes the Authority he hath receiv'd, or cloaths himſelf, as I may ſay, with the Power and Majeſty of God. For we owe more reſpect to the King, when he is in the Seat of Juſtice, than in a Thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſand other Circumſtances; and to the Biſhop in the actual adminiſtration of his Epiſcopal Functions, than at any other time. And indeed we are naturally en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clin'd to meaſure the reſpect due to Grandeur and Pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er by the ſenſible operation they have on us. Certain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly when we are in the Preſence of the Almighty, our Mind ought to proſtrate it ſelf. Now tho' we are always in the ſight of God, yet we come into his Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſence in a more particular manner, when we approach
<pb n="62" facs="tcp:97672:101"/>Superiour, who is his Image. Therefore it is not ſufficient to put on an outward air of Reſpect and Ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neration, but the Mind muſt alſo humble it ſelf, and reſpect the Greatneſs and Power of God in the Majeſty of the Prince.</p>
               <p n="3">III. There is no great difficulty in paying the Duties of Reſpect to the higher Powers; nay the Brain is fram'd in ſuch a manner, that the Imagination willing<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly bows before the ſplendour that environs them; wherefore I think it needleſs to ſay any more of theſe Duties. But an exact Obedience to the commands of our Superiors is a continual Sacrifice, much more difficult and burdenſome than the Slaughter of Beaſts; and therefore Self-love is an irreconcileable Enemy to it. There are few People that diſcharge this Duty like Chriſtians, or in expectation that he whom they Honour in the Perſon of the Prince, ſhould be their only Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward. Every one in a manner diſpenſes with himſelf, as much as he can, from paying an Obedience that doth not ſuit with his own conveniences; and ſome prepoſterouſly obey unjuſt Commands, becauſe they do not know the exact order and meaſure of their Du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties. For oppoſite Powers having each their ſeparate Rights, their different intereſts are many times ſo in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>termingled, that it is very difficult to know which of them ought to be obey'd; and in theſe caſes every Man follows his own particular humour or advantage, for want of certain Rules to govern his Actions by. I ſhall therefore here lay down one or two Principles, which may give us ſome Light toward the clearer diſcovery of theſe Duties.</p>
               <p n="4">IV. There are but two ſovereign Powers in the World, the Civil and the Eccleſiaſtical: The Prince in monarchical States, and the Biſhop: The Prince, who is the Image of God Almighty, and his Miniſter upon Earth; and the Biſhop, who is the Image of Chriſt, and his Vicar in the Church. The Prince derives his Authority over other Men from God alone; ſo doth the Biſhop; and neither of them ought to uſe it any otherwiſe than God doth himſelf, with reſpect to the immutable Order, the univerſal Reaſon, the inviola<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble Law of all intelligent Beings, even of God him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf. The Prince notwithſtanding hath a more abſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lute
<pb n="63" facs="tcp:97672:101"/>Power than the Biſhop. He hath Authority to make Laws, and is not ſubject to them himſelf; he may act without controul, and is not oblig'd to give an account of his Conduct to any Man; for he ſeems to have more Relation to God as Power, than as Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon; to God cloth'd with Majeſty and Glory, than to God made Man, and like us; to Chriſt glorified than to Chriſt upon Earth, and cloth'd with our Vileneſs and Infirmities. But the Biſhop hath more relation to God as Wiſdom and Reaſon incarnate and compaſs'd about with our Infirmities, than as abſolute and inde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pendent Power; to Jeſus Chriſt upon Earth, converſing familiarly with Men, than to Jeſus Chriſt glorified and made ſupreme Lord of all the Nations of the World. <q>Ye know, ſaith our Saviour to his Apoſtles,
<note place="margin">Mat. 20.25.</note> that the Princes of the Gentiles exerciſe Dominion over them, and they that are great, exerciſe Authority upon them. But it ſhall not be ſo among you: The Son of Man came not to be miniſtred unto, but to miniſter, and to give his life a Ranſom for many.</q> Not that Princes have a Right to uſe their Authority without Reaſon. God himſelf hath not this miſerable Right; he is eſſentially Juſt, and the univerſal Reaſon is his inviolable Law. But the abuſe of the Eccleſiaſtical Authority is more criminal in the ſight of God, than the abuſe of Royal Authority; not only becauſe there is an infinite difference between ſpiritual and temporal Goods, but alſo becauſe the Eccleſiaſtical Power that acts imperiouſly and arbitrarily, acts directly contrary to the Character which it bears of Jeſus Chriſt, who is always Reaſon, and Reaſon humbled, and proportion'd to the capacity of Men for their Inſtruction and Sal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation.</p>
               <p n="5">V. The end of the inſtitution of theſe two Powers is very different. The Civil Power is ordain'd for the maintenance of Civil Societies. The Eccleſia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtical Power for the eſtabliſhment and preſervation of the heavenly Society, which is begun upon Earth, and ſhall never end. The Duty of the Prince regards only the peace of the State, the Duty of the Biſhop the peace of Chriſt's Church. The Prince ſhould preſerve and augment thoſe Conveniences that are neceſſary for the temporal Life: The Biſhop by his Preaching and Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ample,
<pb n="64" facs="tcp:97672:102"/>ſhould inſtruct and enlighten the People; and as the Miniſter of Chriſt, diffuſe inward Grace by the Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>craments in the Members of the Church, and thereby communicate the life of the Spirit to thoſe that are com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted to his charge. In a word, the Power of the Prince is ordain'd for the temporal Good of his Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects; that of the Biſhop for the ſpiritual Good of his Children.</p>
               <p n="6">VI. This being laid down as the firſt Principle, the ſecond which follows from it is. That ſince God is the abſolute Lord of all Things, his Orders give a Right to all neceſſary and reaſonable means for the execution of them. A Servant who receives Orders from his Maſter to carry a meſſage of importance with all ſpeed to his Friend, hath no right to take his Neighbour's Horſe, for the execution of his Maſter's commands, becauſe his Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſter himſelf hath not that right. But God being the ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolute Lord of all Things, when he ſaith to St. <hi>Peter, Feed my Sheep;</hi> or when he commands the King to preſerve his Subjects in Peace, he gives to theſe two ſovereign Powers, as far as Order permits, an abſolute right to all Things neceſſary for the execution of his Will. So that the natural, eſſential and primitive Rights of the temporal Sovereignty, are, as far as Order permits, all neceſſary means for the preſervation of the State; and the natural rights of the Eccleſiaſtical Power, are all lawful means neceſſary for the edification of the Church of Chriſt.</p>
               <p n="7">VII. But the Church and the State being compos'd of the ſame Perſons, who, at the ſame time, are both Chriſtians and Members of a Body Politick, Chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren of the Church, and Subjects of the Prince; it is impoſſible for theſe two Powers, which ought to have a mutual regard to each other, and ſhould be abſolute and independent in the Adminiſtration of their ſeveral Functions, to exerciſe their Juriſdiction, and execute the Orders of their common Maſter, if they do not perfectly agree together, and even in ſome Caſes, de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>part with ſomething of their Rights to one another. For this Reaſon it is, that the Prince, by the conceſſion of the Church, hath now a right of Preſentation to many Benefices; and the Church, by the conceſſion of the Prince, enjoys temporal Poſſeſſions. Theſe are not
<pb n="65" facs="tcp:97672:102"/>
                  <hi>natural</hi> rights, becauſe they are not neceſſary or natu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral conſequences of the Commiſſion which theſe dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferent Powers have receiv'd from God: They are on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly rights of <hi>conceſſion</hi> depending on a mutual Agreement, whoſe end ought to be no other than that which God propos'd to himſelf in the inſtitution of theſe two Pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers.</p>
               <p n="8">VIII. The building of the Church of Chriſt, the eternal Temple, being the great, or indeed the only deſign of God, (for all the Societies and Kingdoms of this World ſhall be diſſolv'd, when the Work of him who alone is immutable in his deſigns, ſhall be com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pleated); it is evident that the State hath a reference, and ſhould be ſubſervient to the good of the Church, rather than the Church to the glory, or even the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſervation of the State; and that one of the principal Duties of a Chriſtian Prince, is to furniſh Chriſt with Materials fit to be ſanctified by his Grace under the care of the Biſhop, and to build up the ſpiritual Ede<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fice of the Church. For this end chiefly it is that the Prince ſhould prefer the State in Peace, give Orders that his Subjects be inſtructed in ſolid Learning, ſuch as gives perfection to the Mind, and regulates the Heart, and take care that the Laws ordain'd for the puniſhment of Vice and Injuſtice be ſtrictly obſerv'd. For a People well inſtructed, and obedient to reaſona<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble Laws, is better fitted to receive effectually the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fluence of Grace, than a rude, vicious and ignorant People. For this Reaſon, the Prince ought to employ his Authority in cauſing the Decrees of Councils to be obſerv'd, and keeping the People in the Obedience which they owe to their Mother, the Church of Chriſt. For in fine, there is ſo cloſe an Union between the Church and the State, that he who troubles the State, troubles the Church which conſiſts of the ſame Mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers; and he that makes a Schiſm in the Church, is really a diſturber of the publick Peace and Tranqui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity.</p>
               <p n="9">IX. But whether a Prince doth or doth not propoſe to himſelf this great deſign of gaining immortal Glory by labouring for Eternity, and carrying on a Work which alone ſhall laſt for ever; it is not for private Men to cenſure his Conduct. And provided that he
<pb n="66" facs="tcp:97672:103"/>requires nothing but what flows from the natural Rights given him by the Commiſſion which he hath re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiv'd from God, he ought to be obey'd in all things, even by thoſe that hold the greateſt Dignities in the Church.</p>
               <p n="10">X. It doth not belong to me to deduce from the certain Principles which I have here laid down, ſuch conſequences as contain the particular Duties of thoſe that have a right to command; and beſides, there is more difficulty in it than may be imagin'd. There are a great many circumſtances to be conſider'd, which vary or determine theſe Duties. Princes ſhould examine their own Obligations in the ſight of God, by the light of the immutable Order and the divine Law, rather than refer themſelves to the Counſels of Men, who moſt commonly flatter them. They ſhould alſo conſult the fundamental Laws of the State, and conſider them as the ordinary Rules of their Conduct. So likewiſe the Biſhops, if they would not abuſe their Authority, are bound to obſerve the Laws of the Church, which they have promis'd to keep at their Conſecration.</p>
               <p n="11">XI. But for Subjects, I think it certain that they ought to obey blindly and without reſerve, when only their own intereſt is concern'd: For provided their Obedience to one of the two Powers, do not make them omit the payment of that which they owe to God, or to the oppoſite Power; without doubt, they are bound to obey. To cenſure the Actions of their Sove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reign, is to make themſelves his Judges. It is attribut<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to themſelves a kind of independence, to yield on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly to their own light. It is a Contempt and a Rebel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lion againſt the higher Power, to expect that he ſhould give an account of his Actions to any one but God who hath ordain'd him. But ſtill, this is when he com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mands nothing againſt God himſelf, or againſt the Power which repreſents him. For ſince the Obedience which we pay to our Prince is due to God alone, and refer'd wholly to him, it is clear that we may and ought to diſobey him when he commands us that which God forbids, either immediately by the divine and immutable Law, or by the other Power which he hath ordain'd.</p>
               <pb n="67" facs="tcp:97672:103"/>
               <p n="12">XII. But when the eternal Law doth not anſwer our attention by its Evidence, or when the written Laws are obſcure, and the two ſovereign Powers give us contrary Commands, there is a neceſſity that we ſhould inform our ſelves of their natural Rights, and draw from them ſuch conſequences as ſhould govern our Actions. We ſhould have recourſe to Perſons of underſtanding; and above all, we ſhould carefully examine the Cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumſtances and Conſequences of the Command that is impos'd on us. And when at length we find our ſelves bound by the Obedience which we owe to God, to diſobey either of the Powers which are his Repre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſentatives, we ſhould do it bravely and undauauntedly, but yet with all the reſpect which is due to thoſe that are in Authority. For tho' we are not always bound to obey the Powers ordain'd by God, which are no way Infallible; yet we are ſcarce ever allow'd to caſt of the Reſpect that belongs to them, how much ſoever they abuſe their Authority. They do not loſe their Dignity, nor their Character by unjuſt Commands, and therefore we muſt ſtill honour God in their Perſon: And they on their part ſhould remember, that they have a Maſter who will deal with them as they have treated their Subjects, and that they, as well as other Men, ought to ſubmit to the divine Law, to which God himſelf, if I may ſo ſay, is ſubject. And tho' they may be ſatisfied perhaps that they have a Right to force Obedience from their Subjects, yet they ſhould not be angry, if in ſome difficult and intricate Caſes, they make a ſcruple of obeying them, or do not readily perform their Commands: For Men ought not to be forc'd to act againſt their Conſcience. They cannot all have the ſame ſenſe of things, when there are great difficulties to overcome, before they can under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtand the Order of their Duties. They ſhould be go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vern'd by Reaſon; and when they have not Light and Underſtanding enough to know it, and do not other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe neglect the Duties which they do know, certainly they deſerve compaſſion and indulgence.</p>
               <p n="13">XIII. What I have ſaid of the ſovereign Powers, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>longs alſo to ſubordinate Powers. We owe Obedience to a Magiſtrate, a Governour, or any one that executes the Orders of the Prince, as well as to the Prince him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf; even as we owe to the Prince the Obedience
<pb n="68" facs="tcp:97672:104"/>which is due to God, the Fountain of all Power. We ought not indeed to pay them ſo profound a Reſpect, nor ſo general and blind an Obedience as we do to the Sovereign; even as we ought to obey the Sovereign in ſo univerſal a manner as we do the Law and the Power of God; becauſe they are not inveſted with the whole power of the Prince, no more than the Prince is with the whole power and the Infallibility of God. But we owe them an Obedience proportionable to their power, and to the knowledge we have that they exe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cute the Orders of their Maſter and ours. If we are perſuaded that they encroach upon us, or require of us ſuch Duties as the Prince doth not expect or approve of; we may free our ſelves from their exactions by a dextrous management, or by ſuch ways as do not vio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>late the Reſpect that is due to them, in regard of the Perſon whom they repreſent. We ſhould inform our ſelves of the Prince's pleaſure, from the Prince him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>felf; and if we can have no acceſs to him, we ſhould preſume that he refers himſelf to his Miniſters. And then we ſhould humbly, and without murmuring, ſacri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fice to God the Goods which belong to him, and which he hath given us that we ſhould offer them to him again, and thereby merit the enjoyment of more ſolid poſſeſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions, which no power ſhall be able to take away from us. We ſhould with a truly Chriſtian bravery, ſhew by a ready Obedience our Contempt of tranſitory En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joyments, and look upon the Croſs of Chriſt, not as the Inſtrument of our Puniſhment, but as our triumphal Chariot, which ſhall certainly carry us, as it did our Forerunner and our Pattern, to eternal Thrones, where we ſhall Judge with him the great Ones of the Earth, in the day when the Fire ſhall devour their Riches, and make all their Grandeur to diſappear.</p>

               <head>CHAP. X. <hi>Of the Domeſtick Duties of Husband and Wife. The Ground of theſe Duties. Of the Duties of Parents toward their Children, with relation to the Eternal and Civil Societies. Of their inſtruction in the Sciencies and Morality. Parents ſhould give their Children a good example. They ſhould govern them by Reaſon. They have no right to uſe them ill. Children owe Obe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diene to their Parents in all Things.</hi>
               </head>
               <p n="1">I. THoſe that govern the State have not a continual relation to all the particular Members of which it is compos'd, and there are a great many People who never in their life receive any Command from their So<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vereign or his Miniſters: Therefore that which I have ſaid in the laſt Chapter, is not of ſo great and general uſe, as the Explication of the mutual Duties of Husband and Wife, Parents and Children, Maſters and Servants, a Lord and his Tenants, or thoſe that are under his Ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſdiction, and ſuch Perſons as daily converſe together, and have many different relations to one another. We ſhould inform our ſelves more particularly of theſe pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vate and domeſtick Duties. I ſhall therefore endea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour to fix the Grounds and Principles of them, from which every one may eaſily deduce Conſequences.</p>
               <p n="2">II. The neareſt Union that can be betwixt any Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons, is that of the Man and the Woman; for it ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſly figures the Union of Chirſt with his Church. It is an indiſſoluble Union; for God being immutable in his Deſigns, the Marriage of Chriſt and his Church ſhall continue for ever; it is a natural Union, and the two Sexes, by their particular conſtitution, in conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quences of the admirable Laws of the Union of the Soul and Body, have the moſt violent of all the Paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions for each other; becauſe the love of Chriſt to his Church, and that of the Church to her Lord, her Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viour and her Husband, is the greateſt love that can be imagin'd, as appears from the Canticles. For in ſhort, the Man and the Woman are made for one another.
<pb n="70" facs="tcp:97672:105"/>And if we can conceive that God in creating them, had not a deſign to join them together, then we may al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſo conceive that the Incarnation of the Word was not neceſſary; and that the principal, or the only deſign of God, which is figur'd by the marriage of the Man and the Woman, more particularly than by any other thing, is not the eſtabliſhment of his Church in Jeſus Chriſt, who is the Baſis and Foundation of it, in whom alſo the whole Univerſe ſubſiſts, who brings the whole Work of God out of its prophane State, and by his quality of Son, renders it worthy of the Majeſty of the Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther.</p>
               <p n="3">III. This Principle ſufficiently ſhews, that the mutual Duties of Chriſt and his Church, are the Model of thoſe of Husbands and Wives; and that the Marriage of Chriſtians, like that of the firſt Man and Woman, being the figure of the marriage of Chriſt and the Church, ought not to differ in any of its conſequences or circumſtances from the reality which it repreſents. And therefore St. <hi>Paul</hi> derives from this very Principle, the mutual Duties of the Husband and Wife. His Words are theſe:</p>
               <p n="4">IV.
<note place="margin">Eph. 5.22</note> 
                  <q>Wives, ſubmit your ſelves unto your own Husbands, as unto the Lord. For the Husband is the Head of the Wife, even as Chriſt is the Head of the Church; and he is the Saviour of the Body. Therefore as the Church is ſubject unto Chriſt, ſo let the Wives be to their own Husbands in every thing. Husbands, love your Wives, even as Chriſt alſo loved the Church, and gave himſelf for it; that he might ſanctifie and cleanſe it with the waſhing of Water, by the word; that he might preſent it to himſelf a glorious Church, not having ſpot or wrinkle, or any ſuch thing; but that it ſhould be holy, and without blemiſh. So ought Men to love their Wives as their own Bodies; he that loveth his Wife, loveth himſelf: For no Man ever yet hated his own Fleſh; but nouriſheth and cheriſheth it, even as the Lord the Church; for we are Members of his Body, of his Fleſh, and of his Bones. For this cauſe ſhall a Man leave his Father and his Mother, and ſhall be join'd unto his Wife, and they two ſhall be one Fleſh. This is a great myſtery; but I ſpeak concern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
<pb n="71" facs="tcp:97672:105"/>Chriſt and the Church. Nevertheleſs, let every one of you in particular, ſo love his Wife even as himſelf; and the Wife ſee that ſhe reverence her Husband.</q>
               </p>
               <p n="5">V. From theſe admirable Words of St. <hi>Paul,</hi> we ſee that the Duty of a Husband is to maintain his Wife, and to ſupply her abundantly with all things neceſſary for her ſubſiſtence; to aſſiſt and guide her by his Wiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom and Counſels, and to comfort her in her Afflictions and Infirmities; in a word, to love her as himſelf, and after the example of Chriſt, to expoſe his life for her defenſe. And that the Wife on her part ought to obey her Husband as her Lord, to fear and reſpect him, to ſeek to pleaſe none but him, and to govern the Family in ſubordination to his Authority, and with a depen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence on his Deſigns, provided they are agreeable, or at leaſt not contrary to the deſigns of God.</p>
               <p n="6">VI. Now the deſign of God in the inſtitution of Marriage, is not only to ſupply the State with Mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers to compoſe the Body of it, and to defend and main<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain its Honour and Reputation; but more eſpecially to furniſh Chriſt with Materials for the external Temple, with Members of the Church, and perpetual Worſhip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pers of the divine Majeſty. For married Perſons are not only the Figures, but alſo the natural Miniſters of Chriſt and the Church. God hath join'd them together not only to expreſs his great deſign, but alſo to act in it. It is true, ſince Sin came into the World, they be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>get Children only for the Devil, and by an action al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>together brutiſh; and if it were not for Chriſt our Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diatour, it would be a hainous Crime to communicate to a Woman that miſerable fertility of bringing forth an Enemy of God, to damn a Soul for ever, to labour for the Glory of Satan, and the eſtabliſhment of the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fernal <hi>Babylon.</hi> But Chriſt came to remedy the diſor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders of Sin; and it is permitted by the Sacrament of Marriage, the Figure of his eternal Alliance, to give our Children, as I may ſay, to the Devil, that Chriſt may have the glory to ſnatch them out of his Hands, and having waſh'd them in his own Blood, to make them enter into his Building.</p>
               <pb n="72" facs="tcp:97672:106"/>
               <p n="7">VII. Now the principal Duty of Parents is to edu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cate their Children in ſuch a manner, that they may not loſe their Baptiſmal Innocence and Purity. Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ried Perſons may live in continence, as <hi>Adam</hi> and <hi>Eve</hi> did before their Sin. Chriſt doth not want Materials for the building of his Temple. How many Nations are there ſtill that are ignorant of the Myſtery of our Reconciliation? But that Parents by their Ambition, their Avarice, their diſorderly courſe of Life, their ill Example, nay by barely neglecting to inſtruct their Children, ſhould deprive them of the poſſeſſion of the true Goods, and make them fall again into the ſlavery of the Devil, in which they were Born, and from which they had been once deliver'd; this is the greateſt Crime that Men are capable of committing.</p>
               <p n="8">VIII. A Father may educate his Children ſo as to be the Honour of his Family, the delight of their Country, and the ſupport of the State; he may leave them the peaceable enjoyment of large Poſſeſſions, and all poſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble Splendour: Yet ſtill he is a cruel and unnatural Father, and the more cruel, becauſe he charms their Maladies in ſuch a manner, that they will not be ſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſible of them, till they are paſt remedy: He is Impious and Wicked, and ſo much the more, becauſe with that which he pulls down from the ſacred Temple of the living God, he builds up the prophane <hi>Babylon:</hi> He is Senſeleſs and ſtupid, and the more becauſe there cannot be a greater degreee of Folly, a more groſs Stupidity, a more brutiſh and ſurious Deſpair, than that of a Father who is regardleſs of the inevitable al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ternative of Two very different Eternities, which ſhall ſucceed our lateſt Moments; who builds for himſelf and his Family on the Brow of a Precipice expos'd to Storms and Tempeſts, and juſt ready to bury for ever the miſerable Object of his Glory and Plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſures.</p>
               <p n="9">IX. A Parent therefore that would preſerve to his Children the ineſtimable right which they have ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quir'd by Baptiſm, to the inheritance of Chriſt, muſt be always watchful in removing out of their ſight all Objects that may tempt them. He is their guardian Angel, and ſhould take up out of their way every Stone that may make them fall. It is his Duty to inſtruct
<pb n="73" facs="tcp:97672:106"/>them in the Myſteries of Faith, and by Faith to lead them by degrees to the underſtanding of the funda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mental Truths of Religion, to fix in them a firm hope of the true Goods and a generous contempt of humane Greatneſs. He ſhould ſhape their Mind to Perfection, and teach them to exerciſe the faculties of it. He ſhould govern them by Reaſon; for there cannot be a more perfect Law, than that which God himſelf inviolably follows. But he muſt begin with Faith: For Men, eſpecially the younger ſort, are too ſenſual, too carnal, too much abroad to conſult the Reaſon which dwels within them. It muſt ſhew it ſelf without, cloth'd with a Body to ſtrike their Senſes. They muſt ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mit to a viſible Authority, before they can contemplate the evidence of intellectual Truths. Again, a Father ſhould never grant his Children any thing that they ask themſelves, and never deny them any thing that Reaſon asks for them: for Reaſon ſhould be the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon Law, the general Rule of all our Wills. He ſhould accuſtom them to obey, as well as conſult it. He ſhould make them give a reaſon either a good or a plauſible one, for every thing that they ask; and then he may gratify their deſires, tho' they are not ſo agreable to Reaſon, if he is ſatisfied that their intent was to obey Reaſon. He ſhould not chide them too much, for fear of diſcouraging them. But this is an indiſpenſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble Precept never to act but according to Reaſon. The Soul ſhould will nothing of it ſelf: For it is not its own Rule, or its own Law. It doth not poſſeſs Power; it is not Independent. It ought not to will but with a dependence on the immutable Law, becauſe it cannot think, act, nor enjoy Good, but by a dependence on the divine Power. This is what young People ought to know: But it is perhaps what the old ones do not know: It is certainly what all Men do not practiſe.</p>
               <p n="10">X. We ſhould take care not to burden the Memory of Children with a great number of Actions, which are of little uſe, and ſerve only to confound and agitate a Mind which hath as yet but very little Strength and Capacity, and is but too much diſturb'd and ſhaken al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ready by the action of ſenſible Objects. But we ſhould endeavour to make them clearly comprehend the cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain Principles of ſolid Sciences. We ſhould uſe them
<pb n="74" facs="tcp:97672:107"/>to contemplate clear Ideas, and above all we ſhould teach them to diſtinguiſh the Soul from the Body, and to know the different properties and modifications of theſe two Subſtances of which they are compos'd. We ſhould be ſo far from confirming them in their Error of taking their Senſes for Judges of Truth, by talking to them of ſenſible Objects as of the true cauſes of their Pleaſure and Pain, that we ſhould be always telling them that their Senſes deceive them; and ſhould uſe them in their Preſence like falſe Witneſſes, that claſh with one another to diſcover their Cheats and Illu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions.</p>
               <p n="11">XI. Children dye at ten Years old, as well as Men at Fifty or Threeſcore. What then will become of a Child at his Death, whoſe Heart is already corrupted, who is ſwell'd with eſteem of his Quality, and full of the love of ſenſual Enjoyments? What Good will it do him in the other World, to underſtand perfectly the the Geography of this; and in Eternity, to know the Epochas of Times? All our knowledge periſhes in Death, and the knowledge of theſe things leads to no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing beyond. A Lad knows how to Decline and Conjugate, he underſtands Greek and Latin it may be perfectly well; nay perhaps he is already well vers'd in Hiſtory, and acquainted with the Intereſts of Princes; he promiſes much for this World, for which he is not made; but what ſignify all theſe Vanities, with which his Mind and Heart is ſill'd? Are there ſolid rewards in Heaven for empty Studies? Are there places of Honour deſtin'd for thoſe that make a correct Theme? Will God judge Children by any other Law than the immutable Order, than the Precepts of the Goſpel, which they have neither obſerv'd nor known. Is it the Duty of Fathers to breed up their Children for the State, and not for Heaven; for their Prince, and not for Jeſus Chriſt; for a Society of a few Days, and not for an eternal Society? But let them take notice, that thoſe that are beſt skill'd in theſe vain Sciences, are they that do moſt miſchief to the State, and raiſe the greateſt Tempeſts in it. I do not ſay but they may learn thoſe Sciences: But it ſhould be then when their Mind is form'd, and when they are capable of making a good uſe of it; and the inſtructing of them
<pb n="75" facs="tcp:97672:107"/>in eſſential Truths, ſhould not be put off to a time when they ſhall be no more, or at leaſt not in a condition to Taſt, Meditate and Feed upon them.</p>
               <p n="12">XII. The labour of Attention being the only way that leads to the underſtanding of Truth, a Father ſhould uſe all means of accuſtoming his Children to be Attentive. Therefore I think it proper to teach them the moſt ſenſible part of the Mathematicks: Not that theſe Sciences, tho' preferable to many others, are in themſelves of any great value, but becauſe the Study of them is of ſuch a Nature, that a Man makes no progreſs in them any farther than he is Attentive. For in reading a Book of Geometry, if the Mind doth not labour by its Attention, it gets nothing. Now People ſhould be us'd to the labour of the Mind when they are young: For then the parts of the Brain are flexible, and may be bent any way. It is eaſy then to acquire a habit of being Attentive, in which,
<note place="margin">Part I. Chap. V.</note> as I have ſhewn, the whole ſtrength of the Mind conſiſts. And therefore thoſe that have accuſtom'd themſelves from their youth to meditate on clear Principles, are not only capable of learning all the Sciences, but are alſo able to judge ſolidly of every thing, to govern them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves by abſtracted Principles, to make ingenious diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>coveries, and to foreſee the conſequences and events of Enterpriſes.</p>

This reſting on probabilities makes them wrangle and diſpute endleſly. For as Truth alone is one, indiviſible and immutable, ſo that alone can cloſely and for ever unite Men's Minds. Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſides the Sciences of Memory do naturally beget Pride. For the Soul doth as it were enlarge and extend it ſelf through the multitude of things with which the Head is fill'd. And tho' the content of the Mind be then taken up, as I may ſay, with nothing but Emptineſs, or with things of little or no uſe, as the poſition of Bodies, the the ſeries of Times, the actions and opinions of Men; yet it imagines it ſelf to have as great an extent, du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration
<pb n="76" facs="tcp:97672:108"/>and reality, as the objects of its Knowledge. It ſtretches it ſelf to all the parts of the World. It goes back to paſt Ages; and inſtead of conſidering the nature of its own Being, what it is at preſent, and what it ſhall be in eternity, it forgets its ſelf and its own Country, and wanders in an imaginary World, in Hiſtories made up of Realities which are now no more, and Chimera's which never were.</p>
               <p n="14">XIV. Not that we ſhould ſlight Hiſtory, for ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ample, and never ſtudy any but the ſolid Sciences, ſuch as of themſelves make the Mind perfect, and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gulate the Heart. But we ſhould ſtudy them all in their proper order. A Man may apply himſelf to Hiſtory, when he knows himſelf, his Religion, and his Duties; when his Mind is form'd, and he is thereby capable of diſtinguiſhing, at leaſt in ſome meaſure, between the Truth of the Hiſtory, and the Imaginations of the Hiſtorian. He may ſtudy Languages: But it ſhould be when he is Philoſopher enough to know what a Language is: When he throughly underſtands that of his own Country: And when the deſire of knowing the Thoughts of the Ancients, begets in him a deſire of knowing the Language: For then he will learn more in one Year, than he can in Ten, without this deſire. He muſt be a Man, a Chriſtian, an Engliſhman, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore he is a Grammarian, a Poet, an Hiſtorian, or a Foreigner. He ſhould not ſtudy even the Mathematicks, only to fill his Head with the properties of Lines, but in order to procure to his Mind, that ſtrength, extent and perfection of which it is capable. In a word, he ſhould begin his ſtudies with thoſe Sciences that are moſt neceſſary, or ſuch as may moſt contribute to the perfection of his Mind and Heart. He that only knows how to diſtinguiſh the Soul from the Body, and doth not confound his Thoughts and Deſires with the dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferent motions of his Machine, is more ſolidly learned, and more capable of being ſo, by the knowledge of this one real Science, than he that underſtands the Hiſtories, Laws and Languages of all Nations, but withal is ſo deeply Buried, as I may ſay, in the Ig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>norance of his own Being, that he takes himſelf for the more ſubtil part of his Body, and imagines that
<pb n="77" facs="tcp:97672:108"/>the immortality of the Soul is a Queſtion not to be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolv'd.</p>
               <p n="15">XV. I am ſatisfied that I ſpeak nothing but Para<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doxes, and that it would need a great many Words to perſuade others to be of my Opinion.

Do we find that thoſe who underſtand <hi>Virgil</hi> and <hi>Horace</hi> very well are wiſer Men than thoſe that underſtand S. <hi>Paul</hi> but in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>differently? It is experience that muſt convince ſuch as will not conſult Reaſon.

O, ſay they, we make Boys read <hi>Tully</hi> for the Latin. But why do not they make them read the Goſpel for Religion and Morality? Poor Children! they breed you up like Citizens of old <hi>Rome,</hi> and you will get its Language and its Morals.

We ſhall ſtill ſee young Lads when they come from School, and ought to know ſomething, for none of them ſcarce mind any thing afterwards; we ſhall ſtill ſee them, I ſay, ignorant in the knowledge of Man, of Religion and Morality. For can they be ſaid to know Man, who cannot ſo much as diſtinguiſh the Soul from the Body? Have they learnt the firſt elements of Religion and Morality, who are not fully convinc'd of original Sin, and the neceſſity of a Mediator? They are well ſtockt with the precepts of Grammar. They can ſay <hi>Lilly</hi> by Heart, and repeat all the cramp Words in <hi>Faruaby</hi> and <hi>Butler.</hi> This is ſufficient. They can declaim pro and con on any Subject. A rare Qua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lification indeed, to be able equally to maintain Truth and Falſhood, without knowing how to diſtinguiſh one from the other! But what! It is not reaſonable that Boys ſhould know more than their Fathers: Nor is it fit that they ſhould have more Learning than ſome of their Maſters.</p>

               <p n="16">XVI. But I leave it to Tutors and School-maſters to examine the order of their Duties, and to take care of the performance of them.

Let them not imagine that a Young Man who only underſtands Greek and Latin, and doth not know, much leſs can govern himſelf, is a fit Perſon to in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>form the Mind and regulate the Heart of a Child. But when they have happily met with one that is, let them not by their Example and Behaviour pull down that which a Tutor by his Pains and Diligence hath been build<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing up. Children, by reaſon of their weakneſs and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pendence, are extremely affected with the Language of the Imagination and Senſes, with the outward Air and Behaviour, eſpecially of their Parents.

Perhaps he may ſpeak to them of the true Goods: But then his Diſcourſe ſhall be ſo Cold and Faint, that it ſhall only beget in them contempt and averſion. But you ſhall hear him Twenty times a Day, and that with concern, bid them hold up their Head, keep their Body ſteady, and carry themſelves handſomly. He ſhall applaud and commend them for repeating a few paſſionate Lines with a Grace.

This is a matter that deſerves the greateſt conſideration, with reſpect to the inſtruction and education of Youth.</p>
               <p n="18">XVIII. There are ſome Fathers who always uſe their Children Arbitrarily and Tyrannically: They never do them Juſtice: They are ſevere to them with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out cauſe; and inſtead of enlightning them by Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon, and making them ſubmit to it, they fancy that the Will of a Father is the inviolable Law of a Child. But when the Father is Dead, what then will be the Law of the Son? Without doubt his own Will: For he hath never been told that there is an eternal Law, the immutable Order: He hath not been accuſtom'd to obey it. Nay he will not ſtay till his Father be Dead, or grown Old and unable to keep him in Sla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>very any longer, before he preſcribes a Law to him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf. He will naturally find it in his Pleaſures. For this unjuſt and brutiſh Law is better perhaps than the will of an unreaſonable Father; I am ſure it is more agreable and eaſy. A young Man will quickly be ſatisfied of this, when once he hath taſted the ſweet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs of it. And then whether the Father be dead or alive, the Son will eaſily find means to obey this Law, and yield to its Enchantments. He will look upon his Father as an Enemy and a Tyrant, if he hath yet Strength and Vigour enough left to interrupt him in his Pleaſures, and diſturb him in his Debauches: and Being perſuaded by the example and conduct of his Father, that every thing ought to obey his own Will and Pleaſure, he will employ all his Power, and all
<pb n="80" facs="tcp:97672:110"/>thoſe Perſons over whom he hath any Authority, in gra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tifying his deſires. For he will find himſelf actually happy, in giving himſelf up to his Pleaſures; and will not have Education and Experience enough to appre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hend the fatal Conſequences of them.

               <p n="19">XIX. A Father muſt not imagine that his quality of Father gives him an abſolute and independent Sove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reignty over his Son.

What Right can he have over the Mind and Heart of another Man, from an Action like that of Brutes, an Action which he ought to bluſh at, and which I am aſham'd to men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion? A Mother carries her Burden with a great deal of Trouble and Hardſhip, and brings it into the World with extreme Pains. But ſhe doth not give it Shape and Growth, much leſs doth ſhe give a Being to the Soul which animates her Child: Therefore ſhe hath no Right to command him but in Subordination to the univerſal Reaſon, becauſe ſhe had no power to conceive him, but by the Efficacy of the divine Power.</p>
               <p n="20">XX. Nevertheleſs, a Son ſhould ſtand in fear of his Parents when they are angry with him; for God who gives and preſerves his Being, God who can throw him headlong into Hell, God who hath all manner of Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority over him, commands him by his Law to obey them; and by that command gives them a Right to command him. But Parents ſhould not make uſe of this Right againſt the Will of him from whom they receive it; They ſhould not aſſume it to themſelves as a Reward of a ſinful, or at leaſt an indecent and

And Children on their part ſhould pay Obedience to their Parents, as to God himſelf whoſe Perſon they repreſent; They ſhould ſhew a Reſpect in their preſence as in the preſence of the Almighty; They ſhould endeavour all they can to pleaſe them, and fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther their deſigns, as far as Order permits.

IT is certain that the difference of Conditions a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mongſt Men is a neceſſary conſequence of original Sin, and that many times their Nobility, Riches and Grandeur are deriv'd from the Injuſtice and Ambition of their Anceſtors. But the iniquity of their Forefathers being buried in Oblivion, and the luſtre which their Riches and Honours have left in their Families, ſtill re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maining, we are dazled with the ſplendour of their Quality, which appears bright and ſhining to our Sen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes, and ſtrikes our Imagination; but we never think of the Injuſtice, which perhaps is the original of that ſplendour, becauſe it is not viſible and apparent.</p>
               <p n="2">II. The generality of Men who judge of things by the impreſſion which they make on their Senſes, look upon thoſe that go attended with a magnificent Train, as ſomething more than Men; and inſtead of ſhutting
<pb n="82" facs="tcp:97672:111"/>their Eyes in ſight of a ſtately Palace, that they may make a ſound judgment of the perſonal Merit of him that dwells in it, they open them inſenſibly, to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hold the beauty that courts and enchants them, and join to the Perſon of the owner, all the Gold and Marble with which the Houſe is adorn'd. But a Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtian Philoſopher beholds without being mov'd, the Magnificence which aſtoniſhes and proſtrates weak Ima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginations; and being perſuaded that that which belongs to Man is not the Man himſelf, and that greatneſs of Mind is not conſiſtent with Injuſtice and abuſe of Power, he ſees nothing more monſtrous and deform'd, than a low and deſpicable Soul dwelling in a proud and lofty Building, and admir'd by all the World. And whether he thinks himſelf oblig'd by his quality and the cuſtom of the World to appear ſplendid and mag<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nificent in the Eyes of other Men, or looks upon thoſe vain Ornaments wherewith the rich endeavour to hide their wretched Mortality, he is ſtill ſenſible of his own and others weakneſs, he contracts and as it were anni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hilates himſelf within himſelf, and meaſures great Men only by the merit which he finds in them.</p>
               <p n="3">III. But beſides, that there are very few of theſe Phi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loſophers, how much a Philoſopher ſoever any Man is, he is often ſurpriz'd unawares by the ſenſible impreſſion and unexpected Motions of a rebellious Imagination; and the vanity which fills Mankind, doth ſo much fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour the natural Judgments which are form'd in us without our conſent, touching human greatneſs, that Men always have and ever will judge of the Eſteem which they owe to other Men, by the Train, the Magnificence and the Splendour that environs them. Now theſe Judgments which every one pronounces within himſelf in favour of Perſons of Quality, or ſuch as have the appearance of Perſons of Quality; theſe Judgments, I ſay, which are pronounc'd more ſtrongly and definitively by a ſubmiſſive Air and a re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpectful Behaviour, than by Words, ſwell Men with Pride, and beget in them an Opinion of their own greatneſs. This is it which makes them deſpiſe Vertue and Reaſon in thoſe that are below them, and eſteem, without diſtinction, every thing that is heightned and ſet off to ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vantage by the Quality of the Perſons. This is the
<pb n="83" facs="tcp:97672:111"/>Reaſon that a haughty Lord looks upon his Vaſſals as Creatures of a deſpicable Species; and that Servants hearken to their Maſters as to Vertue it ſelf, and Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon incarnate. In ſhort, this is the Cauſe that Superi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ours do not pay to thoſe that are under them, the Du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties which are owing to their Nature; and Inferiours think it meritorious to act contrary to the divine Law, in obedience to the Commands that are impos'd on them.</p>
               <p n="4">IV. Human Nature being alike in all Men, and cre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ated for Reaſon, it is Merit alone that ſhould diſtin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guiſh, and Reaſon that ſhould govern them. But Sin having left Concupiſcence in thoſe that firſt committed it, and in all their Poſterity, Men, tho' all equal by nature, do not now join in a Society of equality un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der one common Law, to wit, Reaſon. Force, the Law of Brutes, that which gives the Lion the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand over the Beaſts, hath gotten the ſovereign ſway among Men; and the Ambition of ſome and the Neceſſity of others, hath oblig'd all Nations, as I may ſay, to caſt off God, their natural and lawful King, and the univerſal Reaſon, their inviolable Law, and to chooſe them viſible Protectors, who by Force may de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fend them againſt Force. It is Sin then which hath in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>troduc'd into the World the difference of Qualities or Conditions; for Sin, or Concupiſcence being ſuppos'd, theſe differences muſt neceſſarily follow: Reaſon it ſelf requires that it ſhould be ſo; becauſe Force is the Law that muſt keep thoſe in their Duty who have caſt off their Obedience to Reaſon. In fine, God himſelf approves this difference of Conditions, as is plain from the Scriptures.</p>
               <p n="5">V. But the necſſity of the Remedies ſhews the great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs of the Diſtempers. We need not ſeek after them, when we have no occaſion for them; and the eſteem and uſe that ought to be made of Force, is grounded only on the miſerable neceſſity to which we are re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duc'd by our univerſal Contempt of Reaſon. There<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore thoſe that have Authority to command other Men, and to decide their Differences, ought not to value themſelves, and to be proud of this Right; They ſhould rather be afraid of profaning their Power, by making it ſubſervient to their Pleaſures; for nothing is more
<pb n="84" facs="tcp:97672:112"/>Sacred, nothing more Divine. The Almighty, their na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tural and lawful Sovereign, will deal with them, as they, who are but ſubordinate Powers, have dealt with their Subjects. They hold their places but during his Pleaſure; They ſhould continually reflect on this. God can pull them down, if they do not endeavour to ſet up Reaſon; and ſooner or later, Death, that cruel Ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my of their Power, Riches and Pleaſures, will make them like other Men. It will preſent them before the living Law, which penetrates the Heart, and lays open all the folds and receſſes of it; and they will find the Reward or Puniſhment of their good or bad Actions, written in eternal and indelible Characters, in the im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mutable and neceſſary Order.

                  <q>If thou be made the Maſter of a Feaſt, ſays the Son of <hi>Sirach,</hi> lift not thy ſelf up, but be among them as one of the reſt, take diligent care for them, and ſo ſit down. And when thou haſt done all thy of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fice, take thy place that thou mayſt be merry with them.</q> A Family, a Community, a Society, whoſe Head applies himſelf wholly to maintain the Peace and ſupply the Neceſſities of it, is in a continual Feaſt. The Superiour ought not to take his place of Honour,
<pb n="85" facs="tcp:97672:112"/>till he hath perform'd his devoirs, nor put himſelf at the head of others, but only to protect and defend them, to reconcile their differences, and to rejoice them with his preſence. Superiours, and eſpecially Princes, are call'd in Scripture and in ancient Authors, Shepherds of the People; and the Governour of a Feaſt, who di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſturbs the Table, and interrupts the Muſick,
<note place="margin">Hinder not Muſick, verſe 3.</note> repreſents a Head, who breaks the agreeable Harmony and Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cert of all the Members of the Body which he ought to govern and maintain in a perfect Union and a mutu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>al Correſpondence. The end of all Government, is Peace and Charity, and the means of attaining this end, is to advance Reaſon to the ſovereign ſway; for there is nothing but Reaſon that can unite Mens Minds, put them in tune to one another, and make them act in concert. Reaſon is a natural and univerſal Law, which few People obſerve in all Points, but no one dares open<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly reject, and which all Men pretend to follow, even at the ſame time that they depart from it.</p>
               <p n="7">VII. Wherefore a Magiſtrate, a Father, who is the natural Head of his Family, a Maſter who hath Scho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lars or Servants under him; in a word, every Supe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riour ought to breath into his Inferiours a Spirit of Reaſon, Juſtice and Charity, as his and their inviola<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble Law. He ſhould aſſume to himſelf no other Right but the uſe of proper means to make them reſpect and ſubmit to it. But let him not doubt, but that all thoſe means are his true and natural Rights, in propor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion nevertheleſs to the Authority which he hath re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiv'd from the Superiour Power. For the Power which gives any Commiſſion, doth alſo give the ſame Right to the uſe of all lawful means for the execution of it, which that Power it ſelf hath; if it ſelf, or Cu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtom, and eſpecially Reaſon, directs nothing in parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cular touching theſe Means. Thus a Magiſtrate hath no power to puniſh Criminals but according to the Laws, tho' he may by his own Authority make uſe of a thouſand ways to prevent their Villanies where the Laws give no particular directions. A Father may correct his Children with a Rod or a Cudgel, and that ſeverely, but he muſt not kill or maim them, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by render them unſerviceable to the State, on which he himſelf depends, and to which they belong. A Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſter
<pb n="86" facs="tcp:97672:113"/>may whip his Scholar, but he can not uſe him cruelly and injuriouſly without injuring the Father, who hath not given him this Authority, any more than Cu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtom or the Laws of the Community. But, excepting that which Cuſtom, Reaſon, or a Superiour power pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcribes, thoſe that are in Authority may challenge to themſelves as their natural Right, the uſe of all other fit means to reduce ſuch as are under their command to the Obedience, not of their own Will, but of Reaſon; of Reaſon, I ſay, not their own Will; for neither a Father, nor a Magiſtrate, nor a Prince, no nor God himſelf, if this could be, if the Word were not Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſubſtantial with him, if it were poſſible for him not to beget and love it; not God himſelf, I ſay, hath any Right to make uſe of his Power, in obliging Men, who were created for Reaſon, to ſubmit to a Will not con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formable to Reaſon.</p>
               <p n="8">VIII. Notwithſtanding, a Servant, a Scholar or a Subject, ought not to diſpute the Will of his Superi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ours; he ſhould have ſo much Deference for them as to believe that they are rational Men as well as he, and much more than he; and when Evidence or the expreſs Commandment of the Law of God preſcribes nothing to the Contrary, he is bound to obey inſtantly and with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out murmuring. Nay, he is not allow'd ſo much as to offer any Objections, in order to be ſatisfied of his doubts, but only when this kind of Liberty carries with it no ſigns of Contempt, and cannot offend the Perſon in whom he ought to fear and reſpect the Power of God himſelf. But Superiours, on their part, ſhould have a great regard to the nicety and ſcrupulouſneſs of other Men; they muſt not imagine themſelves to be infallible, nor by their haughty and inſolent manner of proceed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, oblige thoſe that are under them to fear them, in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtead of fearing God in their Perſon. The inviſible God is not ſo terrible to weak Imaginations, as the ſenſible and threatning Air of a cholerick Father or Maſter; and many times, a Superiour heated and di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſturb'd by Paſſion, makes his Inferiours commit greater Crimes than he doth himſelf; for the ſuddenneſs of his Paſſion having blinded him, his Fault is leſs voluntary; but the Offence of thoſe that obey him contrary to Reaſon, is the more hainous, becauſe for fear of diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pleaſing
<pb n="87" facs="tcp:97672:113"/>and provoking him, they deliberately offend againſt God.</p>
               <p n="9">IX. Not that a Superior muſt never ſhew his Autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity, and make himſelf fear'd by thoſe that are under his Command. Reaſon requires that he ſhould ſometimes be angry, that as this Paſſion mechanically produces ſomething terrible in the Face, his outward Air may ſtrike a terrour into the Wicked, and diſpoſe them to Obedience: If this will not do, he muſt alſo add Threat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nings, and in the end proceed to Puniſhment, and to a kind of Injury and Violence. It is abſolutely ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſary that Power ſhould make Men ſubmit to Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon, and force them to follow it, when Reaſon it ſelf, tho' well enough known, hath not Charms enough to attract them, Men look upon Reaſon as impotent and unactive, as unable to reward its followers, and to puniſh thoſe that ſide with its Adverſaries. But they muſt be deliver'd from this Error, in which they are confirm'd by all the prejudices of their Senſes, and be convinc'd by their Senſes and by a viſible manner of proceeding, that Reaſon and Power are not two dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferent Deities; that the Almighty is eſſentially Reaſon, and the univerſal Reaſon Almighty. Thoſe that are powerful and reaſonable amongſt Men, by the parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cular relation which they have to the divine Power and Reaſon, ſhould by force conſtrain unreaſonable Minds to fear that Reaſon which they do not love; as they ſhould by Reaſon, diſpoſe ſuch as love it, to unite themſelves to Power, and to rejoyce in it, in ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pectation of their Happineſs, which ſhall be given to them according to the ruſes which the ſame Reaſon pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcribes. Wherefore thoſe that deſpiſe Reaſon muſt be threatned, puniſh'd, and made miſerable. For ſince it is eaſier to obey Reaſon without Pleaſure, than to diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>obey it with Pain, perhaps wicked Men being made ſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſible by the fear of Puniſhment of the greatneſs of thoſe Miſeries which they may avoid, if they will conform themſelves to Reaſon, will be more eaſily diſpos'd to follow the Motions of Grace, without which no Man can pay to the eternal Law, all the Obedience which is due to it.</p>
               <p n="10">X. The Paſſions are not evil in themſelves: No<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing is more wiſely deſign'd, nor more uſeful for the
<pb n="88" facs="tcp:97672:114"/>maintenance of Society than they, provided they are rais'd and govern'd by Reaſon. For ſenſual Men muſt be taught by their Senſes, and carried whether they ought to go, by ſomething which may impel and put them in motion. A Scholar will not gain much ground under the conduct of a ſober, phlegmatick, ſlow-pac'd Maſter, without Spirit and without Paſſion. Children and Servants, whoſe Minds are not faſhion'd according to Reaſon, advance ſlowly toward Vertue, if they be not continually quicken'd, and ſpur'd on. But we ſhould never correct them, without enlightning them, and letting them know what it is that is requir'd of them, and not then neither, except they can perform their Duty with more eaſe than bear the Puniſhment which is inflicted on them. And as no one can deter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mine his choice without ſome Motive, we ſhould put them in a condition to be able to chooſe with Pleaſure, and to do that willingly which is worth nothing if it be not voluntary. The Springs of their Mind ſhould be ſet in order as well as thoſe of their Machine; and the fear of Evil ſhould only ſerve to carry them toward Good, to bring them near to the Light, and make them behold and love the beauty of Order. It is this kind of correction which Men are made to ſuffer, in the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſence and for the honour of that Reaſon which they have caſt off, that enlightens the Mind, and gives un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtanding; and not inhumane and brutiſh Puniſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, which are ſit only to manage Brutes, to train up Horſes and Dogs, and to teach Men to make their own Will the inviolable rule of their Actions.</p>
               <p n="11">XI. Inferiors are oblig'd to pay a ready and exact Obedience not only to the Commands of their Supe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riors which are expreſs'd and ſignified to them, but alſo to their Will, when it is clearly known, tho' it be not ſignified. And tho' he that ſtays for an expreſs Order from his Superior, before he obeys him and performs his Will, doth not hereby ſhew any diſreſpect to his Perſon, or any oppoſition to his Authority; yet he doth not ſufficiently reſpect in him the divine Power and Majeſty. But a Miniſter who by the aſendent he hath over his Prince, by his alliances and creatures draws all the Authority to himſelf, and reduces his Maſter to ſuch a condition that he is afraid to command him, deſerves
<pb n="89" facs="tcp:97672:114"/>to be treated like a Rebel. An inſolent Servant, who by the knowledge he hath of his Maſter's concerns, or of the weakneſs of his Mind, deprives him of the liberty of ſignifying his Pleaſure to him, is many times more guilty of Diſobedience than a lazy and negli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gent Servant, who doth not perform the Orders that are given him. A Son who by the rigorous conſtitu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of his Mind and Body, or by the Reputation and Fortune he hath gain'd in the World, is got into ſuch a Poſt, that his Father who is in a low Condition, weak and impotent dares not impoſe any Command on him, violates the Duties of filial Obedience, if he knows, his Father's Will, and doth not perform it. A Wife who by her untoward and ungovernable Temper is grown ſo formidable to an eaſy good-natur'd Husband, that he dares not diſcover his Mind to her, is more Diſobedient, tho' ſhe exactly performs every thing that he bids her,
<note place="margin">Eph. 5.33.</note> than one that fears and reverences her Husband, according to the Apoſtles Precept, tho' ſhe do not always obey his Commands. An inferior Clergy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man, who by the Credit he hath gotten in the World, or by his Perſonal Qualifications, ſtops the Mouth of his Superiors, and doth not do that which he certainly knows they require of him, is guilty of Diſobedience. In a word, he that withdraws himſelf in any manner whatſoever, from the Obedience which he ows to others, leaves his Poſt, and rebels againſt Authority: And tho' he may ſecure himſelf from the Cenſures of Men, and the Laws of thoſe that do not penetrate and ſearch the Hearts, yet he ſhall not eſcape the Judgment of the righteous Judge, who unfolds all the turnings and windings of Self-love. He that obeys Men as Men, and not as God himſelf, according to the Precepts of Religion, and Reaſon, cannot poſſibly fulfil all the Duties of Obedience; as on the contrary he that de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſires to pleaſe God, in obeying the Commands of Men, is ſo happily guided and influenc'd by that deſire, that he performs eaſily and naturally every thing that the moſt enlightned Mind can impoſe on him.</p>

               <head>CHAP. XII. <hi>Of our Duties toward our Equals. We ſhould give them the place they deſire in our Mind and Heart. We ſhould expreſs our inward Diſpoſitions in favour of them by our outward Air and Behaviour, and by real Services. We ſhould yield them the Superiority and Pre-eminence. The hotteſt and moſt paſſionate Friend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhips are not the moſt ſolid and durable. We ſhould not make more intimate Friends than we can keep.</hi>
               </head>
               <p n="1">I. THE greateſt part of the Duties which we pay to other Men, conſiſt only in certain ſenſible Marks, whereby we give them to underſtand, that they hold an honourable place in our Mind and Heart. Thoſe who are ſatisfied that we have a particular eſteem for their Worth and Qualifications, cannot but feel ſome Emotion and Pleaſure which muſt unite them to us: And there is no Man but muſt be touch'd with a ſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſible Diſpleaſure which will ſeparate himſelf from us, if he finds that we do not give him that place in our Mind which he deſires, how great reſpect ſoever we outward<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly ſhew him. For the place of ſpiritual Beings doth not lye among Bodies; their Habitation, their Seat, their place of Reſt hath no relation to that magnificence which ſtrikes the Senſes, and is only the work of Men's Hands. The Soul dwels with Honour in the very Souls of thoſe that Honour it, and reſts with Pleaſure in the Heart of an affectionate Friend. What Glory, what Honour is it then to poſſeſs the eſteem of the univerſal Reaſon? What reſt and ſatisfaction will theirs be whom God ſhall take into his Heart, and treat them as his Friends? The vaniry of Men ſhould raiſe in us theſe Thoughts, and the Seeds of Pride which we all have in us, ſhould make us aſpire to the Happineſs of getting an honora<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble Place, a fix'd and immoveable Seat in all intelligent Beings united to Reaſon, and in Reaſon it ſelf, and of being our ſelves a ſacred Temple, where God himſelf may reſide for ever: For God, who is a pure Spirit
<pb n="91" facs="tcp:97672:115"/>deth not dwell with Pleaſure in material Temples, tho' never ſo Coſtly and Magnificent.</p>
               <p n="2">II. It is the eternal Wiſdom, the immutable Order of Juſtice, that ſhould regulate theſe ſpiritual Places, which are to be fill'd by ſubſtances of the ſame kind. But as long as we are upon Earth, ſubject to Error and Sin, we deſerve none of them, at leaſt we do not know which of them we deſerve. Therefore we ought al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ways to take the loweſt, and expect to be remov'd high<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er according to the degree of our Vertue and Merit. But Men never trouble themſelves about the place which they hold in the divine Reaſon, the indiſpenſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble Rule of that which they ought to poſſeſs in created Minds, and labour only to advance themſelves to a place which they do not deſerve. They hide their Imper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fections; they ſhew only their beſt ſide; they endea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour by ſeducing others, to get an empty Name to themſelves; and when they have, or fancy they have deceiv'd them, they entertain with extreme delight the doubtful and equivocal marks of an Eſteem, which cannot make a Man truly and ſubſtantially happy or contented, but only when it is govern'd and ſupported by Reaſon, which alone is the ſupreme Judge of Merit, and alone able to give it an eternal reward.</p>
               <p n="3">III. Tho' Honour and Glory, abſolutely ſpeaking, be due only to God, yet created Spirits may alſo challenge it in regard of the relation they bear to the divine Perfections, and the reſemblance they have of the Model by which they were form'd. We have reaſon to believe that they do, in ſome meaſure at leaſt, cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reſpond with their original. We are certain that the Image of the inviſible God, ſtamp'd on the very Foun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dation of their Being, is indelible. Therefore we may, nay and ought, as long as we live with them, to give them marks of Eſteem and reſpect; and ſo much the more, becauſe we cannot acquit our ſelves of the obli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gation we are under to preſerve Charity for them, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out the performance of theſe Duties.</p>
               <p n="4">IV. For, ſince Men invincibly deſire to be happy, they cannot, without an extraordinary degree of Vertue, unite themſelves with thoſe that deſpiſe them; becauſe in conſequence of the Laws ordain'd for the good of Society, they feel an extreme Pain, when they find
<pb n="92" facs="tcp:97672:116"/>themſelves not well entertain'd in the Minds of others. In Winter we get away from ſuch places as are expos'd to Winds and Froſt; becauſe in conſequence of the Laws of the Union of the Soul and Body, the Soul is unhappy in thoſe places. How is it poſſible, when we are govern'd by our Paſſions and Pleaſures, to unite our ſelves to thoſe, whoſe Coldneſs chils and freezes us, to thoſe who ſenſibly afflict us by the incommodi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous and diſagreeable place they give us in their Mind and Heart? Therefore we muſt not think to maintain Charity amongſt Men, to bring them near and unite them to us, and to be ſerviceable to them, if we do not pay them ſuch Duties as may perſuade them that they ſhall live eaſily and contentedly with us.</p>
               <p n="5">V. Since it is not in our Power to infuſe inward Grace into the Hearts of Men, which alone can diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe them to ſacrifice their preſent Happineſs to the Love of Order; we are many times oblig'd to make uſe of their Concupiſcence or Self-love, to moderate their Paſſions, and favour the efficacy of the Grace of Chriſt. For if in the <hi>Old Teſtament,</hi> the Angels, to preſerve the Worſhip of the true God among the <hi>Jews,</hi> govern'd them only by Motives of Self-love, as not being themſelves the diſpenſers of the true Goods, nor of the Grace neceſſary to deſerve them, certainly we ought alſo to labour for the Converſion of Men by thoſe natural means which the general Laws ſupply us with. We muſt Plant and Water, and expect from Heaven the increaſe and maturity. We muſt endeavour to employ to a good purpoſe, the univerſal Inſtrument of Iniquity, the Concupiſcence of Pride and Pleaſure, or rather Self-love, the abundant ſource of all our Miſeries. The Grace of Chriſt coming to our aſſiſtance, will change Men's Hearts, and enable the Weak to go on in the ways of Righteouſneſs, which we ſhall have taught them, by a prudent and charitable management of thoſe things that are in our Power.</p>
               <p n="6">VI. It is certain then, that tho' our Duties for the moſt part conſiſt only in certain outward and ſenſible Marks, by which we ſignify to other Men, that they have ſuch a place in our Mind and Heart, as may con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent their Self-love; yet we are oblig'd to perform them exactly, not with a deſign to advance our own private
<pb n="93" facs="tcp:97672:116"/>Intereſt, nor to fortify and keep up Concupiſcence in others, which we do in ſome meaſure pleaſe and gra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tify by theſe Duties, but to deſtroy and ſacrifice it by the aſſiſtance of the Grace of Chriſt.</p>
               <p n="7">VII. Now tho' our equals do not ſenſibly repreſent the Power and Majeſty of God, to which the ſubmiſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of the Mind is due; yet we ought to treat them as our Superiors, and to give them ſenſible Marks of our inward Reſpect, upon this conſideration, that their Merit, their Vertue, and the inviſible Relation which they have to God, renders them worthy of theſe Duties; or if they are not worthy of them, that we cannot con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tribute to make them ſo, if we do not firſt gain their Friendſhip and Affection.</p>
               <p n="8">VIII. As for thoſe that are below us, we ſhould not treat them as our Superiors, tho' we may look upon them as ſuch, according to thoſe general Words of S. <hi>Paul,</hi> "Let each eſteem other better than themſelves;
<note place="margin">Phil. 2.3.</note> But we ſhould in many caſes treat them as our Equals and Friends. For the main end of our Duties is to pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerve Charity among Men, and to joyn our ſelves with them in an affectionate and durable Friendſhip, that we may be uſeful to them, and they to us. For this end it is neceſſary that our Duties ſhould be ſincere, or at leaſt it ſhould be probable, that we give other Men the ſame place within us, which we expreſs by our out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward Signs. Thus a Superior may deſcend ſo far as to treat his Inferiors like equals, and they will be pleas'd and ſatisfied with it; for there is ſome likelyhood of Sincerity in this. But if he ſtoops below them, they will have reaſon to believe, if they look upon him as a Man of Wit, but not much Vertue, that he mocks and abuſes them. They will be apt to imagine that this exceſſive Humility is only a Blind to cover ſome extraordinary deſign. Or elſe they will deſpiſe him, as a Man of a low and mean Soul, in which it is no advancement to poſſeſs the higheſt Place. They will look upon themſelves to be without a Head, and will live every one according to his own Fancy, when he that ſhould guide and govern them ſo imprudently debaſes himſelf. For when the Head ſtoops too low, the Members deſpiſe him, and he cannot raiſe himſelf up again, without angring and diſcontenting
<pb n="94" facs="tcp:97672:117"/>them. But when he treats them only as his Equals, they are ſenſible that they ſtill have a Maſter, and are not ſurpriz'd to ſee him reſume the Command and Autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity.</p>
               <p n="9">IX. When our Equals out of a Principle of Vertue humble themſelves below us, and give us the prece<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence, yet they do not fully acquit themſelves of their Duties toward us, unleſs they yield us the pre-eminence too, and give us real or at leaſt probable Teſtimonies of a particular Eſteem and Affection. For if we do not believe that their Humiliation is a mark of the eſteem they have for us, our Self-love cannot be ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisfied with it. Vertue may make a Man lower himſelf to one whom he deſpiſes. Now it is more diſagreable and diſpleaſing to be obey'd by one that deſpiſes us, than to be commanded by one that gives us real marks of his Eſteem and Friendſhip. It is Nature many times that gives us Maſters: We may obey without debaſing, without ſacrificing and deſtroying our ſelves: But we cannot naturally and without Vertue love Contempt. This is a thing that can never agree with Self-love; how dextrous ſoever it be in accommodating every thing to its own ends. For we cannot, without the greateſt re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gret, ſee our ſelves ſtrip'd of our Excellence and Gran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deur, in the very Seat of our Pride and Vanity. Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>haps our Equal may give us a great example of Vertue, in putting himſelf below us. We may admire his Hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mility, and perhaps imitate it naturally and out of Pride; for many times the proudeſt Men are the moſt Civil and Obliging. But if he would have us Love him, he muſt give us an honourable and delightful place in his Mind and Heart: He muſt flatter our unjuſt and proud Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cupiſcence. Then, tho' in appearance he be not ſo. obſequious and obedient to our Will, he will be bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter qualified for a Friend; and will perfectly fulfil the Duties he ows us, if he makes uſe of the entrance which we give him into our Heart, by the place which he gives us in his, to mortify our Concupiſcence in us, and ſet up in its place the immutable Order of Ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtice.</p>
               <p n="10">X. It is not ſo eaſy a thing as may be imagin'd, to perſuade others, that they are plac'd in our Mind and Heart as they deſire to be, and to diſcover the true
<pb n="95" facs="tcp:97672:117"/>Sentiments they have of us. We muſt therefore exa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mine what are the leaſt equivocal and moſt ſenſible marks of the inward Diſpoſitions of Men's Minds, that ſo we may diſcover the bottom of their Hearts, and ſatisfy them of the Reſpect and Friendſhip we have for them. It is certain that bare Words are equivocal and deceitful Signs in the Mouths of moſt Men. Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſides, the inſtitution of them being arbitrary, and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pending on the Will of Men, they do not ſtrongly and forcibly perſuade theſe Truths which they expreſs. None but weak People, or ſuch as have a great Opinion of themſelves, will be deceiv'd by them; or it may be ſuch as have no experience of the World. But the Air and Behaviour is a natural Language, which is un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtood without Studying; it perſuades by a lively Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſion, and as I may ſay, diffuſes conviction in the Mind. Beſides, this Language is not deceitful, or if it be, it is very rarely, becauſe it is a natural and in a manner neceſſary effect of the actual diſpoſition of the Soul. For the Soul diſcovers its greateſt Secrets by the Air which it mechanically puts into the Face; and when we are once acquainted with the different Airs, we may diſcover in the Heart of him that ſpeaks, the Sentiments and Motions with which he is agitated in relation to us.</p>
               <p n="11">XI. Therefore if we would perſuade Men that they hold the place which they deſire in our Eſteem and Friendſhip, we ſhould really Eſteem and Love them; and indeed it is our Duty ſo to do. We ſhould in their preſence excite within our ſelves ſuch Motions as they may naturally and ſenſibly underſtand by the Air which theſe Motions give to our Face: And when our Ima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gination is cold in relation to them, becauſe their Merit doth indeed appear very mean and indifferent, we ſhould repreſent to our ſelves ſome Motives that may warm and agitate us: Or at leaſt we ſhould endeavour to manage things ſo, that Men may attribute to the cold<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs of our Conſtitution, that indifference which is ſo grating and diſagreable, and the want of a winning and obliging complaiſance in our Behaviour toward them. But above all things, we muſt take care not to put on a forc'd and affected Air, which betrays it ſelf and cannot hold long, becauſe it doth not agree with the
<pb n="96" facs="tcp:97672:118"/>actual diſpoſitions of our Mind. Nothing is more groſs and offenſive; we had better hold our Tongue, than praiſe any Man with ſuch a fawning and perfidious Air, as tickles and betrays none but ſtupid and ſenſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſs People. Charity and Religion are ſufficient to ſtop the natural Motions of our Machine; for they furniſh us with reaſonable Motives enough to honour and love other Men ſincerely, and to deſpiſe our ſelves.</p>
               <p n="12">XII. But beſide Words and the outward Air and Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>haviour, there are alſo real Services which are the ſureſt and moſt convincing marks of Eſteem and Affection. By theſe it is, that we ſhould make new Friends, and try thoſe that we have already. But as theſe Duties are the moſt difficult and painful of all, ſo we muſt not preſently imagine that he who fails in the performance of them, hath no Affection or Friendſhip for us. For we ſhould conſider, that there are ſome People who by their natural Conſtitution are ſo cold, ſo heavy, ſo re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerv'd, in ſhort, ſo difficult to be ſtir'd, that they do lit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle or nothing for their Friends. But then they do no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing for themſelves neither. This is a thing that ought to be taken notice of; for he that thinks that theſe kind of Men have no Friendſhip for any Body, muſt alſo believe that they do not love themſelves. But I think I may ſay, That generally ſpeaking, there is no Friendſhip more ſolid and durable, than that of thoſe Perſons who ſeem to want Friendſhip, becauſe they have not that ſpritelineſs of Imagination which ſome have; and that ſhort-liv'd Fire, which kindles and blazes out, as ſoon as a Man opens his Heart to them, and doth them the honour to lay before them the need he hath of their Aſſiſtance. The Reaſon of which is this:</p>
               <p n="13">XIII. It is the Fermentation of the Blood, and the abundance of Spirits which heat Mens Imagination, and give them a Motion which animates and impells them. Now thoſe who have ſtrong and lively Paſſions, and a warm Imagination, are inconſtant beyond expreſſion; for it is not Reaſon that governs them, Reaſon which is always the ſame, but Humours, which are ſoon kind<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led and as ſoon go out again; Humours, whoſe Fer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mentation excites contrary Motions every hour. Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſides, 'tis moſt commonly the Body which ſpeaks in
<pb n="97" facs="tcp:97672:118"/>them; and as the Body ſpeaks only for the Body, or for thoſe Things which have a Relation to the Body, the leaſt intereſt determines toward their own particular Profit, the Motion which at firſt was produc'd in them for the Profit of a Friend, only becauſe they found ſome Advantage in it themſelves; for it is always pleaſant and agreable to get new Friends and keep the old ones. In ſhort, there is no ſolid and durable Friendſhip, but that which is founded upon Religion, fortifyed by Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon, animated and ſupported by the charming Pleaſure that proceeds from a mutual Poſſeſſion of Truth. But Religion, Reaſon and Truth, are meer Fantoms to an Imagination that is ſtruck and wrought upon by other Objects. They have nothing in them that affects the Senſes, therefore they have nothing ſolid in them. They have no Relation to the Body, nor to the Society which is form'd by the Body, and for the good of the Body; they have nothing therefore that pleaſes the Imagination, which ſpeaks only for the good of the Body, for that which animates and rejoyces it, which gives and pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerves its Being.</p>
               <p n="14">XIV. When a Man hath entertain'd the unhappy de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſign of making his Fortune in this World, of puſhing forward and advancing himſelf; let him endeavour to make thoſe his Friends, who have a ſtrong and lively Imagination, and let him excite and put them in mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion. Their motion will perhaps carry him to the greateſt Dignities. It is the Imagination that reigns here below, and diſtributes Riches and Honours. There needs only a ſtrong and prevalent Imagination, to give an honourable Place in Mens Minds to a worthleſs Perſon, and to diſcountenance and diſgrace a Man of the greateſt Wiſdom, Learning and Vertue. He then that would advance his Fortunes, muſt ſettle himſelf well in the Opinion of ſuch as are active and ſtirring, he muſt gain their Favour and Affection, and he muſt quicken and ſpur them on; they will carry him a great way; they will lift him to a great height. But let him look to himſelf; nothing is more incomprehenſible, nor more ungovernable than the Imagination; it goes upon very tickliſh Wheels, and very difficult to be kept in order: He muſt be well acquainted with all its fantaſtical and variable Springs, and muſt know how
<pb n="98" facs="tcp:97672:119"/>to try and manage them with Art and Dexterity. For otherwiſe, thoſe Friends that have rais'd him up, will throw him down again, and trample him under their Feet with as many expreſſions of Rage and Indignation, as they have before given him of Favour and Friend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip.</p>
               <p n="15">XV. But for thoſe that are contented with their Fortune, and would have good and real Friends, let them ſeek them among ſuch as are lovers of Truth and Juſtice; let them ground their Friendſhips on a mu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tual Communication of the true Goods, the immutable Goods which make Friendſhips firm and conſtant, the inexhauſtible Goods, which exclude Envy and Jealouſie; and let them aſſure themſelves, that thoſe Perſons who ſeem to be leaſt exact in performing the Duties of Friendſhip, if this proceeds from the natural Coldneſs of their Conſtitution, are the moſt ſincere and faithful Friends. Their Imagination is not ſlippery and incon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtant; but let it be what it will, they can reſtrain and govern it. Their Paſſions are not ſprightly nor vio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent; but they know how to eſteem and love according to Reaſon. Their Friendſhip is not an inconſtant Paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion, but a ſolid Vertue; and tho' it may be for want of Spirits and Flame, they appear cold and unmoveable outwardly, yet they have all the inward Sentiments and Motions for their Friends which they ought to have.</p>
               <p n="16">XVI. But tho' we ought many times to be ſatisfied with thoſe that do not give us ſenſible Marks of their Friendſhip, yet we ought not to be ſatisfied with our ſelves, if we do not give them lively and ſenſible Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſions of ours. For the greateſt part of Mankind being govern'd more by Senſe than Reaſon, they will never be ſatisfied, except they read in our Face, and are convinc'd by our Services, that we are concern'd for their Intereſts. We are bound in duty to make ſome ſteps for them, which we would not make for our ſelves. Perhaps they do not feel the pain that we do in motion; for it may be they love to be in Agitation. They have not the ſame Opinion that we have of the good Things of this Life; for they are blinded by their Paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions. And therefore judging of others by themſelves, they will be apt to believe that we have no Eſteem or
<pb n="99" facs="tcp:97672:119"/>Friendſhip for them, if we do not leave the moſt ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cred and the moſt important Buſineſs, to ſerve them, if we do not do for them, what we would not do for our ſelves; and this belief will infallibly excite in them ſome unjuſt, and it may be ſinful Paſſions.</p>
               <p n="17">XVII. For this Reaſon it is, that Society is a grie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vous and painful ſlavery to thoſe that are not made for it, and can live without it; it is perhaps the ſharpeſt and ſevereſt Penance. It is a Trade, in which many times the honeſteſt and faireſt Dealers loſe much more than they get; they venture a great deal, and make but ſmall Returns. We ſhould therefore enter into no particular Alliances, which oblige us to ſuch Duties, as either the natural Conſtitution of our Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chine, or any other Reaſons will not ſuffer us to per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>form; for we ſhould not get Freinds to make Ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies of them. Nothing is more grievous and irkſome than an Enemy who was once a Friend, and who abuſes the Favours that are beſtow'd on him. Let every one therefore examine his own Strength, and not ſuffer him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf to be overcome by the dangerous pleaſure of know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing and being known; and let him engage himſelf no farther in any Society, than he is able and willing to perform the Duties of it, no farther than that he may be ſerviceable to others without injuring himſelf, or at leaſt that the Injury he doth to himſelf may be leſs than the Service he doth to others.</p>

               <head>CHAP. XIII. <hi>A Continuation of the ſame Subject. If we would be be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lov'd, we muſt make our ſelves amiable. The Qualities which make a Man amiable. Rules for Converſation. Of different Airs. Of Chriſtian Friendſhip.</hi>
               </head>
               <p n="1">I. THough we ſhould not enter into any particular Alliance with all the ſorts of People, eſpecially when we do not find in our ſelves Strength and Art enough to maintain it; yet we ſhould ſtudy to gain the love of all Mankind, to the end there may be no one whom we may not be capable of ſerving. Now the way to be belov'd, is to make our ſelves amiable. It is an unreaſonable and ridiculous pretention to challenge Love and Friendſhip; and thoſe that are not belov'd, ought to blame none but themſelves. If Men do not always do Juſtice to Merit, becauſe they do not know it, and moſt commonly judge amiſs of it, yet every one is a competent Judge of amiable Qualities, and thoſe that poſſeſs them never want Friends. The Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit of other Men obſcures and puts out ours; and when we do them Juſtice, we ſeem to wrong our ſelves. We cannot exalt them, without depreſſing our ſelves, and when we get them below us, we think our ſelves the greater. But we may love other Men, without any injury to our ſelves. Nay, on the contrary, the Soul grows greater as it were by diffuſing it ſelf in the Hearts of others, and ſeems to cloth and adorn it ſelf with the Glory which environs our Friends. So that a Man never fails of being belov'd, if he makes him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf amiable, but he is not always eſteem'd, tho' his Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit be never ſo great.</p>
               <p n="2">II. What then are the Qualifications that make us amiable? They are very eaſie to be diſcover'd. It is not Wit, nor Learning, a handſome Face, or a fine
<pb n="101" facs="tcp:97672:120"/>Shape, 'tis not Quality, Riches, no nor Vertue it ſelf; all this will not do the buſineſs. For a Man may have an Averſion for one that poſſeſſes all theſe valuable Endow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments. What is it then? 'Tis to appear ſuch to others, that they may be perſuaded they ſhall be eaſie and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tented in our Company. If great Riches make a Man covetous; if Wit makes him proud; if Nobility makes him haughty and inſolent; if Vertue and Merit it ſelf makes him think every thing his due; all theſe Quali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fications, how valuable ſoever they be, will never make the poſſeſſors of them amiable. Men would invincibly be happy; therefore he alone can gain the Love, I do not ſay the Eſteem of Men, who is good either in reality or in appearance. Now no Man, how perfect ſoever he may be in himſelf, is good with relation to others, if he doth not impart to them the Favours which God hath beſtow'd on him.</p>
               <p n="3">III. Thus the Man of Wit who ridicules and plays upon every Body he comes near, makes himſelf odious to all the World; and the Scholar, that is always ſhewing his Learning, puts himſelf in the Habit of a Pedant, and appears in a ridiculous Dreſs. Thoſe that have a great deal of Wit, if they would be belov'd, muſt impart it to others. They muſt put ſuch a ſtamp on the fine Things they ſpeak, and make them paſs ſo well, that every one may be ſatisfied with himſelf in their Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pany. He that hath Learning and Knowledge, muſt not magiſterially dictate to others thoſe Truths of which he is convinc'd himſelf; he muſt have the Art to diffuſe Light inſenſibly in the Minds of his Auditors, ſo that every one may find himſelf enlightned, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out the ſhame of having been his Scholar. A liberal Man will never be belov'd, if he takes a pride in ſhew<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing his Liberality, or brags of it. This is in effect to upbraid thoſe on whom he beſtows his Favours, and makes them as much aſham'd. But he who imparts his Wit and Learning, as well as his Mony and Gran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deur to others, without letting it be known, or with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out drawing any Advantage from it, muſt neceſſarily win their Hearts by this vertuous Liberality; the only vertuous, I ſay, and charitable, the only generous and
<pb n="102" facs="tcp:97672:121"/>ſincere Liberality; for all other kind of Liberality is nothing but a mere effect of Self-love; it is all in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tereſted, or at leaſt very ill manag'd.</p>
               <p n="4">IV. But he that is continually expoſing our Naked<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, to advance or divert himſelf to our prejudice; nay, he that for want of due reſpect toward us, takes too much liberty, and uſes too much familiarity with us; in a word, all rude and ill-bred People, beget in us an irreconcilable hatred and averſion. There is no Man perhaps equally ſtrong and hardy in all parts of him; and when we know a Man to be weak in any place, we ſhould not fall upon him there; we can hardly touch him without hurting him. We ſhould uſe all Men with Reſpect and Charity, and be extremely tender of ſtriking them in a ſenſible part. But on the other ſide, we ſhould have a care of reproaching them with their extreme nicety and tenderneſs by an over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cautious and affected Behaviour: We ſhould converſe with them according to Nature, as far as their Quali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, Humour, and actual Diſpoſitions permit us ſo to do; and not be too fearful of ſetting upon them on that ſide where they fear nothing. They lov'd to be attack'd where they are ſtrong and well fortify'd; and are pleas'd with Raillery and Satyr, when they are ſure it cannot hurt them. A Man that hath Wit naturally, loves the exerciſe of the Wit, as well as that of the Body, when he hath a ſtrong and vigorous one. The Reſiſtance he makes, the Victories he obtains, give him Teſtimonies of his Strength and Excellence, and diſco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver them to others, which begets in him a ſecret Plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure and Satisfaction. For Motion delights and en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>livens us; and he that contradicts us impertinently doth not ſo much offend us, as he that gives us no occa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion of ſhewing thoſe Qualities which we fooliſhly admire in our ſelves, and would have others admire too.</p>
               <p n="5">V. Men are much more ſenſible and tender, in rela<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion to thoſe Qualities which are eſteem'd in the World, than to thoſe which are really valuable in themſelves; to thoſe Qualities which concern their Profeſſion or
<pb n="103" facs="tcp:97672:121"/>Employment, than to thoſe Perfections which are eſſential to their being; to thoſe, in fine, which they have not, or rather thoſe which the World doth not much believe they have, whether they have them or not, than to any others. Thus there cannot be a greater Affront put up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on a Souldier who hath not yet given much proof of his Valour, than to call him Coward. For Courage is a thing eſteem'd in the World; beſides, it is thought abſolutely neceſſary for a Souldier; in fine, one that wants it, or fears the World ſhould think he wants it, doth all he can to conceal that kind of Infirmity; for we are very careful to cover every thing that being diſcover'd brings us Shame and Diſgrace. It is the ſame thing with all other Conditions. If an ignorant Lawyer or Phyſician knows that you think him ſo, you ſhall never be his Frirnd, eſpecially if you are ſo in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diſcreet as to ſpeak your Thoughts freely of him, and this comes to his Ears. If you give a Woman cauſe to believe that you think her ugly, you certainly make her angry. For Women value themſelves upon Beauty; as Men do upon Wit; not that they do not pretend to Wit, nay and Learning too; for ſome of them ſet up for Wits and Scholars at a ſtrange rate, and are ſo more than many grave Doctors. We ſhould know the World, if we would pleaſe it; at leaſt we ſhould con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſe with People with ſo much Modeſty, Civility and Reſpect, that they may attribute the Injuries we do them to ſimplicity or inadvertency: There is no other way to make our ſelves belov'd: for it is impoſſible to gain the love of others, when we offend and make them uneaſie.</p>
               <p n="6">VI. The Air and Behoviour is, as I ſaid before, a Language much more expreſſive and intelligible than Words, and repreſents to the life our inward Diſpoſitions in relation to others. We ſhould therefore take a parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cular care to carry our ſelves with an Air of Modeſty and Reſpect, and that in proportion to the Quality and known Merit of the Perſons with whom we converſe: I mean ſuch an Air as ſenſibly ſhews that we do them Right within our ſelves, and willingly give them that place in our Mind and Heart which they deſire, and
<pb n="104" facs="tcp:97672:122"/>think they deſerve. A careleſs and negligent Air is ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceptable only to Inferiours, and is no where tolerable but amongſt Equals. For tho' it be pleaſing in regard it ſhews that we are not much taken up with our ſelves, yet on the other ſide it is diſagreeable, becauſe it is a ſign that we do not much trouble our ſelves about other People. The grave and ſtately Air is very of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fenſive and uncaſie. For beſides, that it denotes a great Opinion of our ſelves, it makes others think that we have but little eſteem for them. This Air is allowable only in Superiours; and is never becoming in them neither, but when it actually repreſents the Power with which they are inveſted. It becomes a Prince, a Judge on the Bench, a Prieſt at the Altar, or any one who by his Character, or otherwiſe, introduces others into the preſence of God. But it makes a Man ridicu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lous and contemptible who puts it on unſeaſonably and prepoſterouſly, and begets in us a ſecret Indigna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion and Averſion for the Vain-glorious Fop that aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſumes it. But for the haughty and diſdainful Air, it is provoking beyond all expreſſion; for it ſhews in a very ſignificant and ſenſible manner, that a Man hath no eſteem nor kindneſs for others. This Air in a Prince makes him look terrible and dreadful; but in a private Man it makes him appear a frightful and ri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diculous Monſter, and muſt naturally beget in others an extreme contempt, and an irreconcilable hatred.</p>
               <p n="7">VII. All other different Airs are compos'd of theſe four: They are all natural and involuntary Effects of the eſteem we have of our ſelves with relation to others; and according as our Imagination is ſtruck, with the appearance of the Quality and Merit of thoſe that are about us, ſo we do inſenſibly and in conſequence of the Laws ordain'd for the good of Society, put on ſuch an Air as is moſt proper to preſerve the place which we think we deſerve in the Mind of others, that place I mean which we actually and at that inſtant imagine we deſerve; for it is not Reaſon, but Imagination which acts in theſe Encounters. It is not an abſtract<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed Knowledge of our own Qualifications with relation to thoſe of others, but a ſenſible View of their Gran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deur
<pb n="105" facs="tcp:97672:122"/>or Meanneſs, and the inward Senſe we have of our ſelves, which ſets the Wheels of the Machine a going, in order to put the Body in ſuch a poſture, and give ſuch an Air to the Face, as diſcovers to Men the actual diſpoſitions of our Mind toward them. It is evident therefore, that to put on that natural and unaffected Air of Modeſty and Reſpect which makes us amiable, to thoſe eſpecially who have a great deal of Pride, it is not ſufficient to believe that other Men are of greater Quality and Worth than our ſelves, but our Imagination muſt be actually mov'd by that belief, and muſt put the animal Spirits in motion, which are the immediate Cauſe of all the alterations which happen in and upon the Body.</p>
               <p n="8">VIII. But the Imagination is ſo unaccountable a thing, and conſequently the Mind of thoſe that ſuffer themſelves to be govern'd by the actual Diſpoſition and Motion of their Machine, that many times the ſame Air cauſes quite contrary effects in two different Perſons, or in the ſame Perſon at different times. This depends on the Fabrick and Poſition of the Imagination, and the quality of the animal Spirits. A pitiful and dejected Air moves Compaſſion in ſome, and Hatred in others, or it may be Contempt or Laughter. Therefore we ſhould open our Eyes, and read in Peoples Faces the effect which our Behaviour cauſes in them, and ſhape or correct our Air by theirs; this is the ſureſt way. And indeed it is what every one doth naturally and without thinking, eſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cially when he ſtands in need of the Aſſiſtance of others, and paſſionately deſires to gain their Favour and Affection. I ſhall ſay no more of the means where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by we may accuſtom our ſelves to ſuch an Air and Behaviour as will make us amiable. The World is ſo corrupted and ſo much given to flattery, that I much fear People would make an ill uſe of it. They are already but too knowing in this matter, and the World is never the better for it, For till Men learn to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſult Reaſon, and to make no account of the outward Behaviour, they will ſtill be govern'd and miſled by the Imagination of ſuch as have a ſprightly Temper
<pb n="106" facs="tcp:97672:123"/>and a dextrous Wit; for it is the Imagination which gives the Face and the reſt of the Body theſe different Airs, which pleaſe and tickle the wiſeſt Men, and ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver fail to deceive the ſimple.</p>
               <p n="9">IX. When a Man grows rich and powerful, he is never the more belov'd, if he doth not grow better too in reſpect of others, by his Liberality, and the Protection he affords them; for nothing is good, nor belov'd as ſuch, but that which doth good, that which makes Men happy. Nay, I know not whether they really love rich Men tho' they be Liberal, or powerful Men tho' they protect them. For generally ſpeaking, they do not make their court to rich Men, but to their Riches; they do not eſteem great Men, but their Greatneſs; or rather every Man ſeeks his own Glory, his own Support, his own Eaſe and Pleaſure. Drunkards do not love Wine, but the pleaſure of drinking; for if the Wine be naught, or do not pleaſe their Palat, they will not drink it. A lewd Man, as ſoon as his Paſſion is ſatisfied, abhors the Ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject that excited it; and if he ſtill loves it; 'tis be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe his Paſſion is ſtill alive. Now all this is becauſe ſading and periſhing Enjoyments can never be a Bond ſtrong enough to join Mens Hearts in a ſtrict Union. A durable Friendſhip can never be built on tranſitory Goods, nor form'd by Paſſions which depend on a thing ſo inconſtant as the circulation of the Blood and Humours: This can only be done by a mutual Poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeſſion of Reaſon, the common Good. The Enjoy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of this univerſal and inexhauſtible Good, is the only thing that can make conſtant, ſecure and eaſie Friendſhips. This is the only Good that we can poſſeſs without Envy, and communicate without injur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing our ſelves. We ſhould therefore excite one another to labour for the acquiſition of this Good, and join all together for the mutual procurement of it. We ſhould liberally impart to others that which we have already gotten, and not ſcruple to demand of them that which they have conquer'd by their Pains and Application, in the Country of Truth. Thus we ſhould enrich our ſelves with the Treaſures of Wiſdom and Reaſon; for we gain a better Poſſeſſion of Truth, the more we
<pb n="107" facs="tcp:97672:123"/>communicate it. The Friends we get this way will be true, conſtant, generous, ſincere and immortal Friends; for Reaſon never dies, Reaſon never changes; it gives to all thoſe who poſſeſs it, immortality in their Life, and immutability in their Conduct.</p>
               <p n="10">X. But who is it that ſhall lead us to Reaſon, who ſhall ſubject us to its Laws, and make us its true Diſciples? It is Reaſon it ſelf; but Reaſon incarnate, humbled, made viſible and ſenſible, and proportion'd to our Weakneſs. It is Jeſus Chriſt, the Wiſdom of the Father, the natural and univerſal Light of intelli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gent Beings, who becauſe he could be no longer the Light of our Minds, immers'd in Fleſh and Blood by Sin, was made Sin himſelf, and by the fooliſhneſs of the Croſs, makes a lively impreſſion on our Senſes, and fixes our Eyes and Thoughts on him. It is Chriſt, and Chriſt alone that can lead us to Reaſon, and reunite us in his Divine Perſon by the mediation of his glorified Humanity. Our Nature ſubſiſts in Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon thro' him, and by him Reaſon will reign in our Minds and Hearts. For in fine, we are created for Reaſon, by that we are intelligent Beings; we were firſt form'd by it, and by it we muſt be form'd anew. Chriſt crucified is our holy Sacrifice, and the perfect Model of the Sacrifice which we muſt offer up of our Self-love to the Love of Order; but be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing rais'd from the dead, conſummated in God, and made an High-Prieſt after the eternal Order of which <hi>Melchiſedech</hi> was the Figure he is the inexhauſtible ſource of thoſe Celeſtial influences, which alone can teach us how to Sacrifice, as he did, our corrupt Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, and thereby to merit a divine Being, a glori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous and incorruptible Transformation; to be perfectly reunited to our Original, and to live wholly on the intellectual Subſtance of Reaſon, by divine Chatity, in perpetual Peace, and in an everlaſting Society.</p>
               <p n="11">XI. If we are true Chriſtians here on Earth, we ſhall be faithful Friends; and we ſhall find faithful Friends no where but amongſt thoſe that have ſolid Piety. For there can be no true and conſtant Friend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip
<pb n="108" facs="tcp:97672:124"/>but in the immutability of Reaſon; and we cannot in our preſent condition conſtantly follow Reaſon, but by the ſtrength which Reaſon incarnate gives us. We cannot ſacrifice our own intereſts to the Laws of Friend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip but by a Charity unknown to Nature, and which derives its original and efficacy from the true Taber<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nacle, where Chriſt exerciſes the Office of High-Prieſt. Your worldly and licentious Friend hath been always faithful to you. It may be ſo. For he always found his advantage in it, or hopes one time or other to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pay his Self-love. But would he ſerve you do you think to his own prejudice, or without the hope of a return, when even the Righteous themſelves are moſt commonly excited to ſerve God, or other Men, only by the hope of a reward, which is ſo much the more grateful to their enlightned Self-love, as it infinitely exceeds the greatneſs of their Services?</p>
               <p n="12">XII. There are really no ſuch things as diſintereſted Friends. They alone may be reckon'd as ſuch, who do not expect their reward from us. They alone can truly be our Friends, who deſire nothing in this tot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tering and unſtable World. They alone are our good Friends, our ſincere, faithful and ſerviceable Friends, who do us Service, becauſe Reaſon and Charity com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand them to do it; and expect from God alone thoſe good Things which are capable of contenting their Self-love, the only enlightned, generous and law<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful Self-love. Let us therefore make choice of ſuch Friends; and for thoſe Friendſhips which we have al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ready contracted, let us endeavour to fix and ſettle them on the immutability of Reaſon, and to purify them by the Sanctity of Religion. Let us make our ſelves amiable, only to make the Law of God belov'd; and let us look upon the Salvation of our Brethren, as the reward of the Services we do them. This reward will ſoon be follow'd by another: And the Glory which we ſhall receive, for having wrought under Chriſt in the finiſhing of his Building, ſhall endure for ever. The Society of the World ſhould tend only to eſtabliſh an eternal Society in Chriſt. We ſhould converſe with Men only that we may labour for their Sanctification,
<pb n="109" facs="tcp:97672:124"/>and they for ours. Certainly God hath ſent us into the World with no other deſign. Happy, then infinite<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly more happy than we can imagine ſhall we be, if by engaging in this juſt Deſign of our common Maſter, we make our ſelves worthy through Chriſt our forerunner, to enter into his reſt, and to enjoy his Glory and Plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure to all Eternity!</p>

               <head>CHAP. XIV. <hi>Of the Duties which every Man owes to himſelf; which conſiſt in general in labouring for his own Perfection and Happineſs.</hi>
               </head>
               <p n="1">I. THE Duties which we owe to our ſelves, as well as thoſe which we owe to our Neighbour, may be reduc'd to this general Head, of labouring for our Happineſs and Perfection: Our Perfection which con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſts chiefly in a perfect conformity of our Will with the immutable Order: And our Happineſs, which conſiſts wholly in the enjoyment of Pleaſure, I mean ſolid and ſubſtantial Pleaſure, capable of contenting a ſpiritual Subſtance made for the poſſeſſion of the ſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preme Good.</p>
               <p n="2">II. The perfection of the Mind conſiſts chiefly in the conformity of the Will to Order. For he that loves Order above all things, hath Vertue: He that obeys Order in all things, fulfils his Duty. And he that ſacrifices his preſent Pleaſure to Order, that ſuffers Pain, and deſpiſes himſelf out of reſpect to the divine Law, merits a ſolid Happineſs, the genuine and ſuita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble Reward of a tried and approv'd Vertue. That almighty and all righteous Law ſhall judge his Cauſe, and ſhall reward him to all Eternity.</p>
               <p n="3">III. To ſeek after Happineſs is not Vertue, but Ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſity: For Vertue is free and voluntary, but the deſire of Happineſs is not in our own Choice. Self-love, properly ſpeaking, is not a quality which may be en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creas'd or diminiſh'd. We cannot ceaſe to Love our ſelves; tho' we may ceaſe to Love ourſelves amiſs. We cannot ſtop the motion of Self-love; but we may re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gulate it according to the divine Law. We may by the motion of Self-love enlightned, ſupported by Faith and Hope, and govern'd by Charity, we may, I ſay, ſacrifice preſent to future Pleaſure, and make our ſelves Miſerable for a time, to eſcape the eternal Vengeance
<pb n="111" facs="tcp:97672:125"/>of the righteous Judge. For Grace doth not deſtroy Nature. The motion which God continually im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prints on us toward Good in general never ſtops. The Wicked and the Righteous equally deſire to be happy: They equally tend toward the ſource of their Felicity. Only the Righteous doth not ſuffer himſelf to be de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiv'd and corrupted by pleaſing appearances: The foretaſt of the true Goods ſupports him in his courſe. But the Sinner, being blinded by his Paſſions, for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gets God, his Rewards and Puniſhments, and employs all the motion which God gives him for the true Good, in the purſuit of Fantoms and Il<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>luſions.</p>
               <p n="4">IV. Self-love therefore, or the deſire of being hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>py is neither Vertue nor Vice: But it is the natural motive to Vertue, and in wicked Men becomes the motive to Vice. God alone is our end: He alone is our Good: Reaſon alone is our Law: And Self-love, or the invincible deſire of being happy, is the motive which ſhould make us love God, unite our ſelves to him, and ſubmit to his Law. For we are not our own Good, nor our own Law. God alone poſſeſſes Power; therefore he alone is to be lov'd and fear'd. We invincibly deſire to be happy: Therefore we ſhould inviolably obey his Law. For we cannot imprint this too deeply on our Minds, that the Almighty is alſo Juſt; that every Diſobedience ſhall be puniſh'd, and every act of Obedience rewarded. In the preſent ſtate of things, wickedneſs and diſorder is attended with Hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pineſs: The exerciſe of Vertue is hard and painful. And it is neceſſary it ſhould be ſo, to try our Faith, and to give us means of acquiring true and genuine Merit. But it muſt not nor cannot continue ſo always. If the Soul be not immortal, if the Face of things ſhall not one Day be chang'd, then there is no God: For an unjuſt God is a mere Chimera. The Mind clearly ſees all this. And what then muſt our Self-love en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lightned, our invincible and inſatiable deſire of Hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pineſs conclude from hence, but that if we would be ſolidly happy, we muſt ſubmit our ſelves entirely to the divine Law? This is evident in the higheſt de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gree.</p>
               <pb n="112" facs="tcp:97672:126"/>
               <p n="5">V. Our Self-love then is the motive which being aſſiſted by Grace, unites us to God, as our Good, or the cauſe of our Happineſs; and ſubjects us to Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon, as our Law, or the model of our Perfection. But we muſt not make the motive our End, or our Law. We muſt truly and ſincerely love Order, and unite our ſelves to God by Reaſon. We muſt prefer the divine Law before all things: Becauſe we cannot ſlight it, and ceaſe to conform our ſelves to it, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out loſing the liberty of acceſs to God which we en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joy by it. We muſt not deſire that Order ſhould accommodate it ſelf to our Will: It is impoſſible to be done; for Order is immutable and neceſſary. We muſt not wiſh that God would not puniſh our Ini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quities; God is a Judge that cannot be corrupted. Theſe deſires corrupt us: Theſe fooliſh and inſignificant Wiſhes are injurious to the Purity, the Juſtice and Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mutability of God; they ſtrike at the eſſential At<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tributes of the divine Nature. We ſhould abhor our own Corruptions, and faſhion all the motions of our Heart by Order: We ſhould revenge on our ſelves the injuries done to the honour of Order; or at leaſt we ſhould humbly ſubmit to the divine Vengeance. For he who wiſhes that God would not puniſh Theft or Drunkenneſs, doth not love God; and tho' the ſtrength of his Self-love enlightned may keep him from Stealing or Drinking, yet he is not Righteous. He makes that the end, which ſhould be only the motive of his deſires. He muſt call upon the Saviour of Sinners, who alone can change his Heart. But he that had rather there ſhould be no God, than ſuch an one as delights to make eternally miſerable even thoſe that truly love Order and Reaſon, is a juſt Man: For that chimerical Deity, that unjuſt and cruel God is not ami<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able. Grace it ſelf doth not deſtroy Self-love, but only regulates it, and makes it ſubject to the divine Law. It makes us love the true God, and deſpiſe that Irregularity and Injuſtice which a diſturb'd Ima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gination may attribute to the divine Nature.</p>
               <p n="6">VI. From what hath been ſaid it is evident, Firſt, that we muſt enlighten our Self-love, to the end it may excite us to Vertue. Secondly, that we muſt
<pb n="113" facs="tcp:97672:126"/>never follow the motion of Self-love only. Thirdly, that in obeying Order inviolably, we labour effectu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally for the contentment of our Self-love. In a word, ſince God alone is the cauſe of our Pleaſure, we ought to ſubmit our ſelves to his Law, and labour for our Perfection; leaving it to his Juſtice and Good<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, to proportion our Happineſs to our Merits, and to thoſe of Chriſt, in whom ours deſerve an infinite Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward.</p>
               <p n="7">VII. I have explain'd in the firſt Part of this Trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſe the moſt material things that are neceſſary to make us labour for our Perfection, or to acquire and pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerve an habitual and ruling Love of the immutable Order; in which our Duties toward our ſelves conſiſt. They are theſe in general.</p>
               <p n="8">VIII. We ſhould accuſtom our ſelves to the labour of Attention, and thereby procure ſome ſtrength of Mind. We ſhould never aſſent but to evidence, and ſo preſerve the liberty of our Mind. We ſhould continually ſtudy Mankind in general, and our ſelves in particular, that we may gain a perfect know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge of our ſelves. We ſhould meditate Night and Day on the divine Law, that we may obey it exactly. We ſhould compare our ſelves with Order, to humble and deſpiſe our ſelves. We ſhould reflect on the divine Juſtice, to fear it, and awaken our ſelves. We ſhould think upon our Mediator, to call upon him, and comfort our ſelves. We ſhould look upon Chriſt as our Model, love him as our Saviour, and follow him as our Strength, our Wiſdom, and the Fountain of our eternal Happineſs. The World ſeduces us by our Senſes: It troubles our Mind by our Imagination; it carries us away and plunges us in the depth of Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſery by our Paſſions. We ſhould break off the dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gerous correſpondence which we hold with it by our Body, if we would ſtrengthen the union which we have with God by Reaſon. For theſe two unions of the Soul, with God, and with the Body, are incom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>patible. We cannot unite our ſelves perfectly to God, without abandoning the intereſts of the Bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy, without deſpiſing, ſacrificing and deſtroying it.</p>
               <pb n="114" facs="tcp:97672:127"/>
               <p n="9">IX. Notwithſtanding we are not allow'd to pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cure our own Death, nor to ruin our Health. For our Body is not our own: It belongs to God, to our Country, our Family, and our Friends. We muſt keep up its ſtrength and vigour, according to the uſe we are oblig'd to make of it. But we muſt not pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerve it contrary to the command of God, and to the prejudice of other Men. We muſt expoſe it for the publick good, and not fear to weaken, ruin and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtroy it in executing the commands of God. And ſo likewiſe for our Honour and our Fortunes. Every thing we have belongs to God and our Neighbour, and muſt be preſerv'd, employ'd and ſacrific'd to the honour of the divine Law, the immutable and neceſſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry Order, and with a dependence on it. I ſhall not enter into the particulars of this matter; for my deſign was only to lay down thoſe general Principles by which every Man is oblig'd to govern his Life and Actions, if he would arive happily at the true and certain place of Reſt and Pleaſure.</p>
