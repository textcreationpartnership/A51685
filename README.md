1. A TREATISE OF Morality.

    _ CHAP. I. Ʋniverſal Reaſon is the Wiſdom of God himſelf. All Men have ſome Communication with God. True and Falſe, Juſt and Ʋnjuſt is the ſame in reſpect of all intelligent Beings, and of God himſelf. What Truth and Order is, and what we muſt do to avoid Error and Sin. God is eſſentially Juſt; he loves the Creatures according as they are amiable, or as they reſemble him. We muſt be Perfect to be Happy; Vertue, or the Perfection of Man conſiſts in a Submiſſion to the immutable Order, and not in following the Order of Nature. The Error of ſome of the Heathen Philoſophers in this Matter, grounded upon their Ignorance of the ſimplicity and immutability of the Divine Conduct.

    _ CHAP. II. There is no other Vertue but the Love of Order and Reaſon. Without this Love all Vertues are falſe. We muſt not confound Duties with Vertues We may diſcharge our Duties without Vertue. 'Tis for want of conſulting Reaſon that Men approve and follow damnable Cuſtoms. Faith ſerves or conducts to Reaſon: For Reaſon is the ſupreme Law of all intelligent Beings.

    _ CHAP. III. The Love of Order doth not differ from Charity. Two ſorts of Love, one of Ʋnion, and the other of Benevolence. The former is due only to Power, to God alone: The latter ought to be proportion'd to perſonal Merit, as our Duties to relative Merit. Self-love enlightned is not contrary to the love of Ʋnion. The love of Order is common to all Men. The Species of the love of Order, natural and free, actual and habitual. Only that which is free, habitual and ruling renders us juſt in the ſight of God. Vertue conſiſts in nothing but a free, habitual and ruling Love of the immutable Order.

    _ CHAP. IV. Two fundamental Truths belonging to this Treatiſe. I. Acts produce Habits, and Habits Acts. II. The Soul doth not always produce the Acts of its ruling Habit. The Sinner may avoid committing any particular Sin, and the juſt Man may loſe his Charity, becauſe there is no Sinner without ſome love for Order, and no juſt Man without Self-love. We cannot be juſtified in the ſight of God by the ſtrength of Free-will. The means in general of acquiring and preſerving Charity. The methodus'd in the explication of theſe means.

    _ CHAP. V. Of the Strength of the Mind. Our Deſires are the occaſional Cauſes of our Knowledge. The Contemplation of abſtract Ideas is difficult. The Strength of the Mind conſiſts in an acquir'd Habit of enduring the Labour of Attention. The way to acquire it is to Silence our Senſes, Imagination and Paſſions, to Regulate our Studies, and to Meditate only on clear Ideas.

    _ CHAP. VI. Of the Liberty of the Mind. We ſhould ſuſpend our Aſſent as much as we can, which is the great Rule. By the Liberty of the Mind we may avoid Error and Sin, as by the Strength of the Mind we free our ſelves from Ignorance. The Liberty of the Mind, as well as the Strength of it, is a Habit which is confirm'd by uſe. Some inſtances of its Ʋſefulneſs in Phyſicks, Morality, and Civil Life.

    _ CHAP. VII. Of Obedience to Order. The means of acquiring a firm and ruling Diſpoſition to obey it. It cannot be done without Grace. How far the right uſe of our Strength and Liberty contributes toward it, by the Light it produces in us, by the contemptible Opinion it gives us of our Paſſions, and by the Purity which it preſerves and eſtabliſhes in our Imagination.

    _ CHAP. VIII. The Means which Religion furniſhes us with to gain and preſerve the Love of Order. Jeſus Chriſt is the occaſional Cauſe of Grace: we muſt call upon him with confidence. When we come to the Sacraments, the actual Love of Order is chang'd in〈◊〉habitual, in conſequence of the permanent deſires of •riſt: The Proof of this Truth being eſſential to the Converſion of Sinners. The fear of Hell is as good a motive as the deſires of eternal Happineſs. We muſt not confound the Motive with the End. The deſire of being Happy, or Self-love, ſhould make us conformable to Order, or obedient to the Law of God.

    _ CHAP. IX. The Church in its Prayers Addreſſes its ſelf to the Father by the Son, and why. We ſhould Pray to the Bleſſed Virgin, Angels and Saints, but not as occaſional cauſes of inward Grace. The Angels, and even the Devils have power over Bodies, as occaſional cauſes. By this means the Devils may tempt us, and the Angels promote the efficacy of Grace.

    _ CHAP. X. Of the Occaſional Cauſes of the Senſations and Motions of the Soul which reſiſt the Efficacy of Grace, either of Light or Senſe. The Ʋnion of the Soul with God is immediate, not that of the Soul with the Body. An Explication of ſome general Laws of the Ʋnion of the Soul and Body, neceſſary for the right underſtanding the reſt of this Treatiſe.

    _ CHAP. XI. What kind of death we muſt die to ſee God, to be united to Reaſon, and to deliver our ſelves from Concupiſcence. It is the Grace of Faith that gives us this happy death. Chriſtians are dead to Sin by Baptiſm, and alive in Chriſt by his Reſurrection. Of the Mortification of the Senſes, and the uſe we ſhould make of it. We ſhould unite our ſelves to corporeal Objects, or ſeparate our ſelves from them without loving or fearing them. But the ſureſt way is to break off all Correſpondence with them, as far as is poſſible.

    _ CHAP. XII. Of the Imagination. This Term is obſcure and confus'd. What it is in general. Several ſorts of Imagination. Its effects are dangerous. Of that which the World calls Wit. That quality is very oppoſite to the Grace of Chriſt. It is fatal to thoſe who poſſeſs it, and to thoſe who eſteem and admire it in others, tho' they have it not themſelves.

    _ CHAP. XIII. Of the Paſſions. What they are. Their dangerous effects. We muſt moderate them. The concluſion of the firſt Part.

    _ CHAP. I. Good Men often do wicked Actions. The Love of Order muſt be enlightned to make it regular. Three Conditions requir'd to make an Action perfectly Vertuous. We ſhould ſtudy the Duties of Man in general, and take ſome time every day to examine the Order and Circumſtances of them in particular.

    _ CHAP. II. Our Duties toward God muſt be refer'd to his Attributes, to his Power, Wiſdom and Love. God alone is the true Cauſe of all Things. The Duties we owe to Power, which conſiſt chiefly in clear Judgments, and in Motions govern'd by thoſe Judgments.

    _ CHAP. III. Of the Duties we owe to the Wiſdom of God. It is that alone which enlightens the Mind in conſequence of certain natural Laws, whoſe efficacy is determin'd by our Deſires as occaſional Cauſes. The Judgments and Duties of the Mind in relation to the univerſal Reaſon.

    _ CHAP. IV. Of the Duties which we owe to the divine Love. Our Will is nothing but a continual impreſſion of the Love which God bears to himſelf, the only true Good. We cannot love Evil: But we may take that to be Evil, which is neither Good nor Evil. So we cannot hate Good: But the true Good is really the Evil of wicked Men, or the true cauſe of their Miſeries. That God may be Good in reſpect of us, our Love muſt be like his, or always ſubject to the divine Law, Motions or Duties.

    _ CHAP. V. The three Divine Perſons imprint each their proper Character on our Souls; and our Duties give equal Honour to them all three. Tho' our Duties conſiſt only in inward Judgments and Motions, yet we muſt ſhew them by outward Signs, in regard of our Society with other Men.

    _ CHAP. VI. Of the Duties of Society in general. Two ſorts of Society. Every thing ſhould be refer'd to the eternal Society. Different kinds of Love and Honour. The general heads of our Duties toward Men. They muſt be External and Relative. The danger of paying inward Duties to Men. The Converſation of the World very dangerous.

    _ CHAP. VII. The Duties of Eſteem are due to all Mankind, to the loweſt of Men, to the greateſt Sinners, to our Enemies and Perſecutors: To Merits, as well as to Natures. It is difficult to regulate exactly theſe Duties and thoſe of Benevolence, by reaſon of the difference of perſonal and relative Merits, and their various Combinations. A general rule, and the moſt certain one that can be given in this matter.

    _ CHAP. VIII. Of the Duties of Benevolence and Reſpect. We ſhould procure all Men the true Goods, and not relative Goods. Who it is that fulfills the Duties of Benevolence. The unreaſonable Complaints of worldly Men. The Duties of Reſpect ſhould be proportion'd to the greatneſs of participated Power.

    _ CHAP. IX. Of the Duties due to Sovereigns. Two Sovereign Powers. The difference between them. Their natural Rights. Rights of Conceſſion. Of the Obedience of Subjects.

    _ CHAP. X. Of the Domeſtick Duties of Husband and Wife. The Ground of theſe Duties. Of the Duties of Parents toward their Children, with relation to the Eternal and Civil Societies. Of their inſtruction in the Sciencies and Morality. Parents ſhould give their Children a good example. They ſhould govern them by Reaſon. They have no right to uſe them ill. Children owe Obediene to their Parents in all Things.

    _ CHAP. XI. The original of the difference of Conditions. Reaſon alone ought to govern, but Force is now neceſſary. The lawful uſe of Force is to make Men ſubmit to Reaſon, according to the Primitive Law. The Rights of Superiours. The Duties of Superiours and Inferiours.

    _ CHAP. XII. Of our Duties toward our Equals. We ſhould give them the place they deſire in our Mind and Heart. We ſhould expreſs our inward Diſpoſitions in favour of them by our outward Air and Behaviour, and by real Services. We ſhould yield them the Superiority and Pre-eminence. The hotteſt and moſt paſſionate Friendſhips are not the moſt ſolid and durable. We ſhould not make more intimate Friends than we can keep.

    _ CHAP. XIII. A Continuation of the ſame Subject. If we would be belov'd, we muſt make our ſelves amiable. The Qualities which make a Man amiable. Rules for Converſation. Of different Airs. Of Chriſtian Friendſhip.

    _ CHAP. XIV. Of the Duties which every Man owes to himſelf; which conſiſt in general in labouring for his own Perfection and Happineſs.
